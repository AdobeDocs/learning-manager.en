# Adobe Captivate Prime desktop application

Learn how to use Adobe Captivate Prime's desktop application to create and enrich content that can be shared on Social Learning.

The Adobe Captivate Prime desktop application is primarily meant for learners who use Captivate Prime Social Learning. Once installed on a desktop, the application enables learners to create content and post them to boards in Captivate Prime to facilitate informal, collaborative, and social learnings among peers. In addition, the desktop application also ensures that learners get Social Learning notifications on their desktop, even if they are not necessarily logged into Captivate Prime's web application. 

Learners can create rich content including video, audio, and screenshots and share them with other learners. The content could literally be anything – a software demo or walkthrough, a presentation, a podcast, or an annotated screenshot of something that can be shared.

On Captivate Prime Social Learning web page, click new Post and select record video, or record audio, or take a screenshot, or Captivate Prime gallery to launch the desktop application. For more information on Social Learning, [click here](feature-summary/social-learning-web-user.md).

If users do not have the desktop application, you can download it from the Adobe Captivate Prime desktop page. If you are unable to download, [click here](../kb/troubleshooting-issues-with-adobe-captivate-prime-desktop-app.md).

Once the user has finished installing the application, he/she must sign into it using their Captivate Prime learner credentials. The home page appears like the below screenshot. 

Learners will not be able to use the desktop application if Social Learning is disabled for their account.
