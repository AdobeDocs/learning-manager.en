# Advanced AI search in Adobe Learning Manager 

Adobe Learning Manager is revamping the way learners search courses or training. It introduces an AI-powered search capability that combines lexical and semantic search. The search is now smarter, as it looks for specific terms and understands the context and intent behind them. The advanced search understands the meaning of your query and provides relevant results. It identifies the main focus of the search to give you the most complete set of results.

In the screenshot above, when we search for **photoshop getting started**, the AI-powered search shows the most accurate results for that keyword.

This capability searches your content and third-party course titles, descriptions, tags, personalized notes, and other metadata. The algorithm automatically transcribes and searches right within the transcript for content types like Video, PDF, and even recordings from **Adobe Connect** sessions. 

The algorithm uses sophisticated AI and NLP (Natural Language Processing) to understand the search query, mark the essential keywords, and logically expand the other phrases from the searched query. This query expansion boosts relevant terms and semantically related context to retrieve courses, certificates, or learning paths more intelligently. The semantic search currently supports only English content.   

The results from the semantic search and lexical searches are weighted with a proprietary model and ranked to yield the most relevant and precise results. The AI-based algorithm calculates the ranking based on freshness, ratings, popularity, and others to deliver the best results based on your needs.
