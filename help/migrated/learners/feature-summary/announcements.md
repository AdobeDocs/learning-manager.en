An announcement is a multimedia message (text, image or video) that an Administrator broadcasts to a defined set of users.

Administrator can broadcast announcements to learners informing them about the occurrence of an event or an activity.&nbsp;When an announcement is broadcast to a particular group or learning object users, all the learners associated with the target group receive notifications.

# Announcements notification {#announcementsnotification}

A notification broadcast message appears on the learnerâ€™s dashboard as a highlighted title bar. If the learner is not online at the time of announcement, the notification appears whenever a learner logs into the Learning Manager application. Learners can also view old announcements from notifications.
