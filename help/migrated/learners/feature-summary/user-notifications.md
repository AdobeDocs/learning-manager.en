# User notifications

Captivate Prime Learning Programs are renamed to Learning Paths. This change happens immediately after the October 2021 release and the terminology of Learning Path is reflected for all roles.

User notifications for Learners in Captivate Prime.

Notifications feature is applicable to all the users of Adobe Learning Manager. But, each user based on their role gets different kinds of notifications under various scenarios. All the alerts and notifications to users are displayed through notifications pop-up dialog.

## Access notifications {#accessnotifications}

Users can see notifications by clicking notifications icon at the upper right corner of the window.

This pop-up window displays highlights of all the notifications along with time of occurrence and a scroll bar.

You can know the number of latest notifications based on the highlighted number on top of the notifications icon. For example, if there are five latest notifications after your previous login, you can see the number 5 being displayed on top of the notifications icon. These numbers disappear once you read all the latest notifications.

Learners can reject a course assigned to them by Managers by clicking Reject in notifications pop up window.
