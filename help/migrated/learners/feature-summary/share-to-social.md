# Share to Social Learning

Learn how to use Social bookmark-let to instantly share a user's online learnings onto the social web.

Share to social learning is a bookmarklet that allows learners to share their online learnings like web pages and blogs with their peers. This feature is supported only on desktop browsers.

On clicking this bookmarklet from the bookmark bar, it opens as a pop-up window with or within the web page depending on the browser that is to be shared.

Ensure that you allow pop-up windows in your browser. 

If you are logged into Learning Manager, then the bookmarklet automatically logs into your account, otherwise, you have to sign in using your Learning Manager credentials as a learner.

Add a description for your post and then select the board in which you want to post to and click **Post**. The board is posted on your dashboard which can be viewed by clicking **Go to Post**.
