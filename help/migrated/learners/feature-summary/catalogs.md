Learn how to use Catalogs in Learning Manager to view the eligible learning objects

**Catalog** consists of all the courses, learning programs, certifications and job aids that are available for a learner role in the company account.

Learners can view all the assigned and eligible learning objects (learning programs, courses and certifications) in the **Default Catalog**. These learning objects are unique to each learner based on his role, designation, user group, profile, and so on.

You can sort the learning objects based on different categories like Products, Job Roles, Types, Time needed, Skills, and Keywords. You can also filter using the options in the left pane: by Learning Objects, by skills, and by completion status.

Use the search bar on top of the page to enter the names of your familiar learning objects. Learners can switch between the grid and the list view by selecting this ![](assets/icon-list.png) icon.

<!--As a learner, you can  filter training based on the format of training, for example, Classroom, Self-paced, or Virtual Classroom. In addition, the learner can also filter the trainings based on Training Duration. Skill Levels filter which is already available, can now be enabled/disabled by Administrator. -->

You can also filter according to the duration of a training. The duration filter does not include duration of pre-work and test-out.

*Filter by course duration*

The training **Duration** and **Format** filters are identified based on the training content available for default instance and for the account preferred locale.

Once a training is published, the training may take up to one hour for the data to be available as a filter.

## Sorting functionality in the learner app

The sort feature in the learner app provides personalized course recommendations based on the content and interface language. â€‹ This enhancement simplifies the process for learners to find courses in their preferred language and utilize more intelligent sorting options.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This feature is available on both the web and mobile app.

You can sort courses alphabetically::

1. **[!UICONTROL Name (A-Z)]**: Displays courses in alphabetical order.
2. **[!UICONTROL Name (Z-A)]**: Displays courses in reverse alphabetical order.

Courses are displayed in the following priority order based on language preferences:

1. **[!UICONTROL Content Language]**: Courses in the selected content language appear first.
2. **[!UICONTROL Interface Language]**: Courses in the interface language are listed next.
3. **[!UICONTROL Other Languages]**: Courses in random languages are displayed last.

If no content language or interface language is configured in the account, the system follows this sequence:

1. **[!UICONTROL Browser Language]**: The app prioritizes courses based on the browser's language settings.
2. **[!UICONTROL Account Language]**: If the browser language is not available, the ALM account language is considered.
3. **[!UICONTROL Default to English]**: If the browser or account language is unavailable, courses are shown in English.

Select **[!UICONTROL Catalogs]** page in the learner app and then select your preferred sorting option: **[!UICONTROL Name (A-Z)]** or **[!UICONTROL Name (Z-A)]**. The courses will be displayed according to your selected sorting preference, with language-based prioritization applied.
