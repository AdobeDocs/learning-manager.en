# Social Learning in Captivate Prime

Learn how to use Social Learning web as a learner

Social learning is a platform in Captivate Prime which engages users to share ideas and meaningful insights in an informal environment. It is a methodology which supplements the idea of traditional learning. Completing an online course does not give an advantage to users to interact with their peers at a social level.

By simply attending a training, does not guarantee that users retain everything that is taught. On the other hand, social learning allows users to use the expertise around them to get exactly the information they need. In turn users can quickly apply that information to complete a task, and achieve a goal.

Similarly, Captivate Prime Social Learning feature allows users to be able to interact with one another by being able to share and learn from content.  

On this platform, the different type of content that can be shared are video, audio, screenshot, text, question, and poll. Users can also share their online learnings with their peers by using the **Share to Social bookmarklet**. For more information, see  [Share to Social Learning](share-to-social.md).

Content can also be posted inside a board with the help of the **Adobe Captivate Prime desktop application**. For more information, see  [Adobe Captivate Prime app for desktop](../adobe-captivate-prime-app-for-desktop.md).

Only if the administrator enables Social Learning, the feature is visible to a learner .
