Learn how to take up certifications using the Learning Manager Learners app.

Certify your learners on a one time basis or on a recurring time frame using this feature. Only administrators can define the certifications for learners.

Learners can take up the certifications which are assigned to them by the administrators of the organization. There are two types of certifications in Learning Manager.

1. External  

   These certificates can be obtained from outside of your organization. Your organization recommends you to take up these certifications and submit proof.

1. Internal  

   These certificates can be obtained by completing certain courses prescribed as part of the curriculum. Your organization issues these certifications after completion.

## Taking up internal certifications {#takingupinternalcertifications}

   A page appears with a list of all learning objects relevant to you.

## Completing certifications {#completingcertifications}

The certification completion criteria depends on how many courses the author or the administrator has set as mandatory. For example, for a certification containing four courses, if the author or administrator has set two courses as mandatory, then when a learner completes two courses out of four, the learner achives completion status.

On the other hand, if all the courses are mandatory in a certification, then the learner needs to complete all the courses in the certification.
