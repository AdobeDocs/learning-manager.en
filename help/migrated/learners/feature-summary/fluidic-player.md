**TOC** - While taking up a course, the player displays a table of contents for that course on the left pane of the window. You can click each topic and navigate to it directly. 

**Bookmarks** - If any of the course modules has a module TOC, then topics in module TOC can be bookmarked to refer later. When bookmarked, a star icon appears next to the TOC entry. Bookmarks can be deleted by clicking the star again.

**Notes** - A provision is available to record notes while you are taking up the course. After recording the notes, you can save and download it as PDF or e-mail the notes to e-mail ids of any registered learners. When you click Save, you get an option to choose the location for saving it as PDF file.
