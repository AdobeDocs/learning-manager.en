# Learner home page

## Overview {#overview}

After the Administrator enables Immersive layout, the learner is greeted with a completely revamped User Interface when signing into the app.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The IE11 browser does not support the Immersive layout.

## New learner UI for Immersive layout

>[!IMPORTANT]
>
>We will release the new learner UI in phases. 

We have refreshed the Learner UI with a more sleek and updated design. The new UI aims to provide a consistent user experience across **[!UICONTROL Learner Home]**, **[!UICONTROL My Learning]**, **[!UICONTROL Catalog]**, and **[!UICONTROL Course Overview]** landing pages. The new visual elements follow current design styles, making the product look more easy to use and attractive. This update includes a new masthead, side panel, and contemporary widgets.

>[!NOTE]
>
>The revamped User Interface applies only to the Immersive layout. The mobile web/app does not support these changes yet and will update them in a future release.
