# Overview {#overview}

After the Administrator enables Immersive layout, the learner, after signing&nbsp;into&nbsp;the app,&nbsp;is greeted with a completely revamped User Interface.&nbsp;

**Note:** The Immersive Layout is not supported on the IE11 browser.

Based on whether a widget was enabled, the learner sees the following:&nbsp;

# Masthead {#masthead}

Features a video or image carousel with an embedded&nbsp;URL. The [Administrator can upload any image or video](../../administrators/feature-summary/announcements.md#masthead) asset as a masthead and set its visibility for a group of learners.

**Add to My learning List**

If you hover on any course card in the **Recommended based on your areas of interest** and **Recommended based on peer activity lists**, you can see an option to add the course to the **My Learning List**.

The widget summarizes activity for a period. It:

* Displays active users and their activities of the users who are in your scope or group.
* Displays posts made in the last two weeks.

# Profile Skills {#profileskills}

Profile skills are used for course recommendations. If the Administrator assigns a skill to a user or group of users, the skill gets added to the profile skills of the learner. If the learner adds a skill to his/her profile, all levels of the skill get added to the learner's profile skills. When a learner hovers on a skill, he/can see the name of the skill, method of addition of the skill, level, percent of completion of the skill, and credits.

![](assets/profile-skills.png) If a learner enrolls in a course, only the external skills that are based on a score get added to the profile skills. In addition, a learner can&nbsp;search, select, and add external skills to his/her profile. If a learner has logged in to the learner app for the first time, and if the learner's skills are already present, the skills appear on My Profile. 

# Recommendation based on your area of interest {#recommendationbasedonyourareaofinterest}

Displays training based on your chosen area of interest. The recommendation is driven by a Machine Learning algorithm.&nbsp;

![](assets/learner-recommendation.png)

For more targeted recommendations, you can update your skills by clicking on&nbsp;**View/Update**.&nbsp;

After you add a skill, future recommendations will become more targeted and focused according to your preferences.

If the Admin disabled the option **Explore Skills**, you would be able to add interest to your skills.

The recommended courses are displayed as cards. When you&nbsp;mouse&nbsp;hover a card,&nbsp;you can see more details of the course.

Product terminology is also supported.

**Industry Aligned Skills**

You will be able to see the network graph of skills if the Admin has enabled the option **Industry Aligned** in the Admin app.

These skill can only be viewed when the Admin sets the training type to Industry Aligned.

In the Skill Map visualization, you can search for a skill or skills and add those.

![](assets/learner-add-industry-skills.png)

Enable the option **Show Skills for which trainings are present in my account**,&nbsp;if you want to display all the skills that are in your account.

After you add a skill, you can see the force directed graph with the selected skill as the primary vertex and the associated skills as smaller vertices.

The skills that you chose also displays in the **Selected Skills** section.

# Recommendation based on peer activity {#recommendationbasedonpeeractivity}
