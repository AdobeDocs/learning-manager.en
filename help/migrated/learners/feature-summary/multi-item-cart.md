# Multi item cart in ALM

Learners can now add several courses, learning paths, or certifications to the cart and purchase them together. They can purchase multiple courses, learning paths, or certifications at once using cart. This feature is available only in the learner apps (existing UI, new learner UI, and mobile immersive app).

## Pre-requisites

To use this feature, the admin needs to enable the multi-item SKU Cart in the settings menu. 
In the admin app, select **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL General]**, and select **[!UICONTROL Enable Multi Item SKU Cart]** option. This enables learners to purchase multiple courses at once.
