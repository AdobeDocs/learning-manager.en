## Feedback rating {#feedbackrating}

Captivate Prime prompts the learner to provide feedback about their experience with the Mobile App. This feedback appears once in a month and gives enough time interval for users to experience the app and then provide the feedback.

| ![](assets/image013.png) | ![](assets/image014.png)|
|---|---|

For existing users, they should see the feedback popup once they close the Player for the first time after updating the app to latest version.

Note that the feedback collection is anonymous and appears only for users who've enabled the option **Share Usage Data** via a configuration in App settings.

## Download badge {#downloadbadge}

Learners can download their badges in PDF and Image format. In the User profile section, scroll down, and click any link to download a badge. The downloaded badge is saved in the default device folder. The app allows you to open the folder or the file immediately after the download completes.

## Mobile web responsive layout {#responsive}

A completely responsive mobile web experience that ensures that learners use their devices to consume training even if they haven't installed the mobile app.

When you first sign into the learner app via the browser on your device, the learner app shows up in the form of a mobile-friendly, responsive layout.

The mobile web responsive UI support is only available when an account **is configured for immersive layout only**. The responsive UI is **not available for classic layout**.

Social learning is a platform in the Captivate Prime mobile app, which engages users to share ideas and meaningful insights in an informal environment. It is a methodology that supplements the idea of traditional learning. 

Social learning allows users to use the expertise around them to get correct and concise information. Learners can quickly apply that information to complete a task and achieve a goal.

Using the mobile app, users can interact with one another by sharing content and get validation for the shared content.

On this platform, the different type of content that can be shared are video, audio, screenshot, text, question, and poll. Users can also share their online learnings with their peers.

This feature is only available on the device app once the Admin enables **Social Learning** for the account.

## Launch social learning on the app {#launchsociallearningontheapp}

Upon launching the app, tap the **Social** icon.

## Create a post in a board {#createapostinaboard}

To create a post, tap the (![](assets/prime-add.png)) icon on the bottom-right of the screen.

## Take courses from LinkedIn Learning {#linkedin}

Captivate Prime already supports LinkedIn Learning courses within the learning platform. Now learners can take up such LinkedIn Learning courses within the Captivate Prime mobile app. In the device app, search for a course, and then start the course.

If you have the LinkedIn app already installed, the course will open in the app, or else the course will open in the default browser, where you must log in using your LinkedIn credentials. 

If you are taking the course via the LinkedIn app, your progress will not be tracked inside Captivate Prime. Hence, it's recommended that the course is launched in the browser instead of the LinkedIn Learning app. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>You can only take the courses if you have an active internet connection.

| ![](assets/start-course.jpg) | ![](assets/enroll-course.jpg) | ![](assets/sign-in.jpg) |
|---|---|---|

Learning time spent in LinkedIn Learning courses is communicated by the LinkedIn content/LinkedIn platform to Captivate Prime learning platform.

In case LinkedIn learning does not send the learning time, it cannot be recorded by our learning platform. In such case, learning time spent displayed by Captivate Prime is zero.

## Submit file for classroom and activity modules {#submitfile}

As a learner, you can submit files as proof of course completion to your instructor. The instructor can then approve or reject your submission, based on the contents of the file.

An author can create only classroom and activity modules for a learner to consume in the mobile app.

After the learner starts a course, the learner can see the status **File Submission** as pending along with the link to upload file, on the screen, as shown in the screenshot below.

![](assets/pending-approval.png)
