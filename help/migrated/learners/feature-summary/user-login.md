Log in as a learner in Learning Manager.

When using Adobe Learning Manager for the first time, learners need to create an account. You can do this in one of two ways:

* Self-registration: Use the URL provided in the welcome email to create your account.
* Admin-created account: An admin can create an account on your behalf.

## Create an account using the welcome e-mail URL

Follow these steps to create your account using the URL from the welcome email:

1. Launch Adobe Learning Manager using the secure link you received by welcome e-mail from your Administrator.

   Login screen appears.

1. Select Log in.
