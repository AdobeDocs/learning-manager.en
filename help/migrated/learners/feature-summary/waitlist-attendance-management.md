# Waitlist & attendance management {#waitlist-attendance-management}

Administrators can manage attendance and waitlisting of courses for learners.

## Waitlist management {#waitlistmanagement}

Learners are waitlisted for any classroom course when the seats are limited, based on the order of their enrollment. Learners get enrolled into the course as soon as Administrator allocates a seat.
