# Waitlist & attendance management {#waitlist-attendance-management}

Administrators can manage attendance and waitlisting of courses for learners.

Learners are waitlisted for any classroom course when the seats are limited, based on the order of their enrollment. Learners get enrolled into the course as soon as Administrator allocates a seat.
