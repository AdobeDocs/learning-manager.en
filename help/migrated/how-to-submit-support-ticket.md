# How to submit a support ticket on Experience League

The process for submitting Adobe Learning Manager support tickets is now directly integrated with the Experience League support platform. This is a self-service portal that was recently redesigned to offer more personalization and ease-of-use for entitled customers. Check out this guide below for more information on how to access the Experience League Support portal and log a ticket.
 
Please note that submitting a Support ticket is only available to authorized support contacts. For your support queries, please continue to submit your support tickets to Adobe Learning Manager until May 11th, 2025. Following this date, you can submit your support tickets via the Experience League Support portal as described below.

1. To access the Support portal, visit the **[!UICONTROL Experience League]** website and select the **[!UICONTROL Support]** tab located at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can visit the [direct link](https://experienceleague.adobe.com/home#support).
