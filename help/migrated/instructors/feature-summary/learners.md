## See sessions or modules with pending reviews {#pending}

As an instructor, you can see the sessions or modules with pending reviews. 

On the Sessions/Modules page, you can see a column **Reviews Pending** that shows the number of pending reviews for the corresponding session/activity.

As the Learners register for your module, you can see the latest status of the enrollment and waitlist from the Waitlist page.

1. From the Instructor App, select Upcoming Sessions > Waitlist in the left navigation pane.

   You can view the Seat Limit, number of seats that are currently filled, and the number of seats vacant. A table also lists the Learners who have been waitlisted. This is blank if there are no waitlist queues.

## Send emails to learners {#sendemailstolearners}

You can send emails to specific or all attendees for your session. The Send Email feature is very useful if you want to confirm the attendance of learners, or if you want to send out communication regarding the session. You can also use the Send Email to All option to email the assignment and session material, or send out general communication to all the learners.

To send emails to learners, from the Learners page in the Instructor app, do one of the following:

* To send emails to specific attendees, select the attendee, and click Actions > Send Email to Selected.
* To send emails to all the attendees to send a course material or an assignment, click Actions > Send Email to All.

## Exporting learners list {#exportinglearnerslist}

As an instructor, you can easily mark the attendance for all your learners by exporting the attendee list as a pdf. To export the attendee list, from the Learner from the left pane. Click Actions > Export Learner List (PDF). 

After the attendee list is confirmed for your session, you can export the list as a PDF. This easy-to-print pdf displays the learners as a table. You can then mark the attendance or provide scores, and make or provide notes for the learner, all in the same PDF. 

Notice a QR code at the top right corner of this PDF. This functionality allows individual learners to scan the code using the Learning Manager mobile app for learners to mark their attendance.
