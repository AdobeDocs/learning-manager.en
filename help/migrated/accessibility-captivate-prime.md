Adobe Learning Manager Learner role allows learners to&nbsp;navigate through the platform and take advantage of following key accessibility capabilities:

* Screen Reader

* Others

## Support for Screen Readers {#supportforscreenreaders}

Adobe Learning Manager supports screen readers like NVDA, JAWS, and Voice-over on desktop, Talkback and Voice-over on mobile, which enable learners to read out the text on Learning Manager platform and navigate accordingly.

Here is the screen reader and browser combination that we support on desktop:

<table> 
 <tbody>
  <tr> 
   <td><p style="text-align: left;">Operating System</p> </td> 
   <td><p style="text-align: left;">Browser</p> </td> 
   <td><p style="text-align: left;">Screen reader</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Windows</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Chrome</p> </td> 
   <td><p>NVDA</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Windows</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Firefox</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Jaws</p> </td> 
  </tr>

   <td><p>macOS</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Safari</p> </td> 
   <td><p>VoiceOver</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Android</p> </td>

   <td><p>VoiceOver</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
 </tbody>
</table>

## Support for Keyboard navigation {#supportforkeyboardnavigation}

Learners can use standard keys to navigate through the pages with or without screen reader. This helps the learners to navigate elements on the page and read content using a screen reader.&nbsp;

In addition, Learning Manager supports the following keyboard shortcuts:

<table> 
 <tbody>
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Feature</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Windows</p> </td> 
   <td><p>macOS</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Skip navigation</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Alt+1</p> </td> 
   <td><p>Option+1</p> </td> 
  </tr> 
  <tr> 
   <td><p>Feature<br> </p> </td> 
   <td><p>Windows<br> </p> </td>
