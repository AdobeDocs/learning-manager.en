To allow learners to reset a module and consume the module again, click Reset. From the pop-up dialog box, click Yes to confirm the Reset. Modules that have been completed cannot be reset. Only failed or incomplete modules can be reset.

You can also export the learners list in an excel sheet. To export the learners list, click Actions > Export.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If there are multiple instances for a course, the learners list in excel is provided in each tab separately. The learners list consists of learner name, status and selection criteria. Learners status can be **Not started**, or **In progress**, or **Completed**. 

## View L1 and L3 feedback {#viewl1andl3feedback}

You can view the L1 feedback provided by learners for a course and the L3 feedback provided for members of your team.

1. Click any course tile in the Courses list.

1. Click any course tile from the list of courses on the page.
1. Click Preview as learner from the left pane and click the module name on the page to preview the course module in the player.

## Course effectiveness {#courseeffectiveness}

Course effectiveness is evaluated to understand the usefulness of a course to the learner. It is a combination of results from learner feedback on the course content, the course quiz results for a learner and the manager's feedback evaluating a learner based on learnings from the course.

You can view the course effectiveness rating on the course thumbnails as shown in the below snapshot. You can see the rating for this course as 100.

![](assets/course-effectiveness-tag1.png)

The course effectiveness rating value is arrived considering L1, L2 & L3 feedback values. To view the breakup of each feedback, click the course effectiveness value. A pop-up appears as shown below.

![](assets/course-effectiveness.png)

In this sample snapshot, 1 out 1 users received all the three feedbacks, hence the score is 100/100. From this table, you can understand that if any of the three feedbacks (L1, L2 and L3 ) are not provided for a course, there is a negative impact on the overall effectiveness. Click the down-arrow at the lower-right corner of the pop-up to view how course effectiveness calculations are done.

![](assets/course-effectiveness-calculations.png)

As per the pie-chart shown above, more weightage is given to L3 feedback from manager.

## Optional submission for external certifications {#optional}

In earlier releases of Learning Manager, for an external certification to be completed, a Manager accepted the file that a learner had submitted. The Manager gets a notifications only after the learner submits the file.

A Manager can now see a list of learners who have enrolled into the External certification on a Submission page present inside the External Certification and can Accept or Reject from the page itself without waiting for a notification.

When the Manager accepts without waiting for the file submission, the learner is shown a new message that the Manager has accepted, and the learner need not submit the file. In case Manager rejects without the file submission, the Manager has the option to again accept without waiting for the file.

If learner submits the file, Manager can view the file from the submission page and can Accept or Reject based on the submitted file.

![](assets/optional-submission.png)

When courses are set as mandatory:

* The submission page ists the learners only after the learners complete the courses.
* The learner can only upload a file after completing the course.

## Job Aids {#jobaids}

The manager can manage the assignment of Job Aids for his reporters. But, as a Manager, you can only see the published job aids while an administrator can also see withdrawn job aids.
