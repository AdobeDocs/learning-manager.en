# User notifications

Captivate Prime Learning Programs are renamed to Learning Paths. This change happens immediately after the October 2021 release and the terminology of Learning Path is reflected for all roles.

Setting up User notifications for Managers.

Notifications feature is applicable to all the users of Adobe Captivate Prime 1.0. But, each user based on their role gets different kinds of notifications under various scenarios. All the alerts and notifications to users are displayed through notifications pop-up dialog.

## Access notifications {#accessnotifications}

Users can see notifications by clicking notifications icon at the upper right corner of the window. In Manager login, you can also click Notifications at the left pane to access these notifications.

A manager can see the pending tasks and all notifications in a tabbed form at the notifications page. Pending tasks notifications are categorized based on approvals, nominations and so on. To view all the notifications, click **All Notifications** tab. In all notifications tab, the notifications are ordered based on date and time and listed.

You can get to know the number of latest notifications by the highlighted number on top of the notifications icon.

These numbers disappear once you read all the latest notifications.
