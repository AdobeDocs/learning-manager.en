Users can purchase from curated playlists covering various topics or purchase the entire catalog. 

On the page, you can see two tiles, Enterprise Training and Creative Cloud Training. The first tile launches the marketplace, using which you can acquire courses for your learners. The latter launches the content catalog.

The Enterprise Training page in the Administrator app enables you to invite users and download the Express Interest report, and also purchase the entire catalog or curated playlist.-->

To invite the learners:

1. Select the **[!UICONTROL Content Marketplace]** from the administrator homepage.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Invite learners]** and select the required learners.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Invite learners]**. 

Administrators can also revoke access to the **[!UICONTROL Content Hub]** by selecting the **[!UICONTROL Remove all users access]** link. Once access is revoked, learners will no longer see the Content Hub page in their learner app.

<!--## Purchase

You get unlimited access to the entire library of courses. Click the **[!UICONTROL Purchase]** button to download a Purchase Request form.

![](assets/purchase-request.png)

*Enter the number of seats to purchase*

Specify the number of seats for which you want to purchase the courses for. Download the purchase request form and then send the form to the sales team of Learning Manager.

The team will then validate the information and then generate a key, which will be provided to you. This is the activation key using which you'll grant access to your users to the content offering.

After the key is generated by the CSAM team, the Administrator can use the key to import the courses, and migrate the courses into the existing catalog or the new catalog.

During migration of courses, the status displays as **[!UICONTROL Importing Courses]**. Once the migration completes, the Administrator gets a notification that migration is complete and successful.

The **[!UICONTROL Licenses]** section then displays all the licenses that are acquired for the account.

The Administrator can see the links of the purchased catalogs in the Catalog Overview page.

Once the courses are added to the catalog, the Administrator can then grant access to the trainings to various user or user groups.

<!--## Express interest report

When a learner clicks Express interest to Catalog in the Learner app, the interest is recorded in an Express interest report. The Administrator can download the report. The report (csv) contains the following fields:

* Name of the catalog
* Number of users expressing interest
* Email of the user expressing interest-->

## Content Hub

Content Hub allows administrators to shortlist required playlists from learner app. The Content Hub page is visible to administrators in their learner role all the time as it allows them to shortlist playlists easily. To help you in shortlisting the right playlist, administrators can make this page accessible to limited Subject matter experts in their account. 

Adobe Learning Manager syncs regularly with the Content Hub, ensuring that new additions and updates are automatically reflected in the platform.

All content is mapped to supported languages, allowing administrators to filter and manage content more effectively based on language preferences.

## Email templates

Adobe Learning Manager offers pre-configured email templates that notify administrators and learners about content purchases, system updates, and learning activities.

There are three email templates that you can use:

1. **[!UICONTROL Content Activation Successful]:** Sent to administrators after a successful purchase of third-party content. This notification confirms that the activation is complete and that the purchased content is now available in the system for learner assignment.
2. **[!UICONTROL Automated User Upload Failure]:** Triggered when an automated user import via CSV fails. This alert helps administrators quickly identify issues in scheduled user updates, so corrective actions can be taken.
3. **[!UICONTROL Invite Users to Explore Content]:** An invitation email that's sent to learners once the administrator purchases content from the marketplace. After that, users can start their learning journey immediately.

<!--Purchased courses cannot be added in recurring certificates.
Purchased courses cannot be shared to peer accounts.
Purchased courses can be consumed by all users who get access to it. Configure the catalog visibility to restrict the visibility of purchased courses to limited users.
Purchased courses cannot be consumed once the activation key expires. Please purchase/activate another key to allow consumption.-->
