# Content marketplace

Learning administrators often struggle to find high-quality content on various topics and add it to their learning platform. Without an integrated marketplace, bringing third-party content into the LMS usually requires external procurement, formatting, and manual uploads. The Content Marketplace solves this problem by letting you license premium courses from trusted providers with one click, directly in Adobe Learning Manager. This ensures faster rollout and more scalable learning programs.

The Content Marketplace in Adobe Learning Manager (ALM) lets administrators browse, preview, and license third-party courses from top providers. Organizations can easily add off-the-shelf learning to their training catalogs, delivering fast, scalable learning across many topics.

As an admin, you have two plan options:

* **[!UICONTROL Premium Essentials]**
* **[!UICONTROL Premium Essentials Plus]**

These plans are designed to fit different: Business needs, Locations and Budgets

**[!UICONTROL Premium Essentials]**:
A cost-effective solution designed to enhance employee engagement. 

* Access to over 90,000 courses
* Content from more than 250 providers
* Focus on compliance and skill improvement

## Email templates

Adobe Learning Manager offers pre-set email templates that notify administrators and learners about content purchases, system updates, and learning activities.

To support this workflow, there are three email templates that you can use:

1. **[!UICONTROL Content Activation Successful]:** Sent to administrators after a successful purchase of third-party content. This notification confirms that the activation is complete and that the purchased content is now available in the system for learner assignment.
2. **[!UICONTROL Automated User Upload Failure]:** Triggered when an automated user import via CSV fails. This alert helps administrators quickly identify issues in scheduled user updates, so corrective actions can be taken.
3. **[!UICONTROL Invite Users to Explore Content]:** An invitation email that's sent to learners once the administrator purchases content from the marketplace. After that, users can start their learning journey immediately.

<!--Purchased courses cannot be added in recurring certificates.
Purchased courses cannot be shared to peer accounts.
Purchased courses can be consumed by all users who get access to it. Configure the catalog visibility to restrict the visibility of purchased courses to limited users.
Purchased courses cannot be consumed once the activation key expires. Please purchase/activate another key to allow consumption.-->
