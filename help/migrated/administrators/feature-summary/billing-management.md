   The annual subscription fee is calculated based on the number of users who are added for the subscription. For example, if four users are being added, the annual fee is calculated using the expression 4 usersX$4X$12, which returns $192.

   Click **Proceed**.

1. On the Payment Details page, you can view the estimated price of the order. The

   currency appears based on the current locale.

## Check order status {#checkorderstatus}

All orders can have one of the four statuses:

**Active:** An order is active, and users are registered successfully.

**Suspended:** An order moves into suspended state in the following scenarios:

* Delay in receipt of payment from the credit card
* Expiry of the credit card.
* Payment is declined for any recurring payment cycle.

**Canceled initiated:** An order moves into this state when the Captivate Prime Administrator deactivates the account. The order then moves into a canceled state after receiving the cancellation confirmation of the order.

## Update subscription details {#updatesubscriptiondetails}

1. In the list of orders, click **Edit**.

   ![](assets/update-subsciptiondetailsclickedit.png)

1. In the Subscription details page, click **Edit Subscription**.
1. Choose the item that you want to edit:

   * Payment method: Use this option to update payment details, such as, credit card.
   * Address: Use this option to update address details.

## Cancel a subscription {#cancelasubscription}

To cancel an order:

1. In the left pane of the Administrator page, click Billing.
1. In the Billing page, on the upper-right corner, choose **Actions** > **Deactivate Account**.
1. Once the Administrator deactivates the account, all existing orders in the account are canceled from the next billing cycle.

When an account is deactivated by the customer, it enters a trial state for the next 30 days. The account owner receives three reminder emails to revive the account. If the owner does not reactivate the account, none of the users are able to access Captivate Prime apart from the owner.

## Place orders using Purchase Order {#placeordersusingpurchaseorder}

You can choose purchase order process as an alternative mode of payment. As a pre-requisite, your organization's account must be registered with Adobe. Your organization account is charged for this process. The account is charged based on a learner's activities. Only Learning Object-level activities are charged. To place an order using PO:

1. Send an email to [captivateprimesales@adobe.com](mailto:captivateprimesales@adobe.com) and mention the number of required learners.
1. The Captivate Prime team sends you an activation key.
1. In the Billing page of the Administrator app, enter the activation key.
1. Click Activate in the upper-right corner of the page.

## Check account status {#checkaccountstatus}

After an account gets activated, the account can be in any of the following states:

* **Trial** - You can create an Adobe Learning Manager account and use it without any payment for a period of 30 days. There is no limit on the number of learners registered during the trial period.
* **Active** - In this state, the account has active learner subscriptions with recurring monthly payment as per the subscription order.
* **Inactive** - An account moves into inactive state in the following scenarios:

  * After the trial period if there are no active subscription orders in the account.
  * Administrator deactivates the account, which results in canceling all the existing orders in an account from the next billing cycle of subscription.
  * Payment is declined for active orders in an account even after reminders.

An inactive state does not cancel your account with immediate effect. You receive at least a couple of reminders from the Captivate Prime team asking you to provide the latest information about

your credit card if it has expired. In an inactive state, only an administrator can log in to the Captivate

Prime account. All other users cannot access the account.

* **Activation required** - Your account moves into this state when the Captivate Prime administrator chooses to deactivate the account. All the orders of this account get canceled. The collection of payment for these orders does not happen from the next billing cycle. The status of the account remains in this state until the day of the last billing cycle. In this state, all users can continue to use the application without any impact until the end of the last recurring payment date.

## Cancel a subscription {#Cancelasubscription-1}

To cancel an active subscription, contact the Captivate Prime support team.

## Account termination fee {#accountterminationfee}

If you want to cancel the subscription before the completion of the annual term, an early termination fee is charged. The termination fee is equivalent to 50% of the subscription price of the remaining commitment period.

## Monthly Active Users (MAU) plan {#monthlyactiveusersmauplan}

You can choose a MAU plan as your preferred way of billing. This option generates billing based on the number of monthly unique active users. The monthly unique active users are added cumulatively for a period of 12 months starting from the month of plan activation. This number is used for billing for the period.

Use the following example to understand how MAU is calculated.

Let there be a case where the number of users per month are as follows:

* Month 1 = 50
* Month 2 = 500
* Month 3 = 5000
* Month 4 to 12 = 10

Total Monthly Active Users that are billed = Month 1 + Month 2 + Month 3 + Month 4 to 12 = 50 + 500 + 5000 + 90 = 5640.

The billing for the period would be for 5640 users.

At the end of the 12-month period, the usage count is reset back to zero and a new period for MAU plan starts. You can add multiple activation keys to increase the purchased number of seats.

Any user who performs the following actions or achieves completions due to actions taken by others is considered as a monthly unique active user for that calendar month.

* Consuming a course, learning program or certification.
* Consuming, downloading a Job Aid or course attachments.
* Consuming, downloading or creating personal notes.
* Participating in Social Learning by creating Boards, posts or comments.
* Achieving completions due to External Certificate submission approvals or attendance for a classroom/virtual classroom sessions.
