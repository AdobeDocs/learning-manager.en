**Login methods** - Administrators can choose the mode using which your internal or external users can access the account. 

* **Internal users:** For internal users, you can set Adobe ID or Single Sign-on as a log in mode. 
* **External users:** For external users, you can set Adobe ID or Single Sign-On or Learning Manager ID.

If you choose, Learning Manager ID, external users can log into this account after creating their Learning Manager username and password.

>[!NOTE]
>
>If there are multiple external profiles set, all profiles can have any one type of login. For example, if login type is Adobe ID, all profiles have to login using Adobe ID only. Each profile cannot have its individual login type.

You can access Learning Manager application using Adobe ID or by using Single Sign-On. Single signâ€‘on is a mechanism that allows a user to authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications many number of times. This configuration is not mandatory for the organization. If your organization has SAML 2.0 based SSO provider, you can use it to configure Learning Manager application. The configuration is required at your organization level and at Learning Manager application. If you choose to use SSO, contact Adobe support to receive configuration instructions

**Feedback**

## AI-based recommendation

Learning Manager includes a brand-new learner homepage, which is modern, more content-driven, and personalized according to a learner's preferences. AI-based learning recommendations aim to enhance learner engagement and identify and address gaps in learning.

The recommendation algorithm is designed to take in multiple sources of input including Industry data on Job roles, titles and descriptions that Adobe has sourced from its partners. This data is then used to train Adobe's AI algorithms so that Learning Manager can come up with a map that connects industry aligned skills to job titles and/or designations. This then becomes one input to the recommendation algorithm

Learning Manager then uses topic modeling algorithms to analyze the training content within an account and map them to the skills.

Learning Manager uses peer activity data as another signal to drive the recommendation algorithm in a personalized manner. Activities like enrollment, completion and any explicit feedback provided by learners is used here.

Additionally, Learning Manager uses explicit and implicit information gathered from individual learners to further personalize recommendations. A learner will be able to indicate their areas of interest explicitly through enrollments and Learning Manager will receive this information implicitly based on how the Learner ends up taking up the trainings.

Finally, the Admin will also be able to influence the recommendation algorithm using learner attributes that Learning Manager should look at when defining peer groups, and also by actually highlighting Trainings for specific user groups.  

## Renaming Learning objects {#renaminglearningobjects}

This feature is only available in English language.

Administrators can now rename Learning Objects in Learning Manager. The following are the terminologies that can be renamed.

Module  
Course  
Learning Program  
Certification  
Learning Plan  
Job Aid  
Catalog  
Skill  
Badge  
Announcement  
My Learning  
Leaderboard  
Effectiveness  
Prerequisite  
Prework  
Core Content  
Testout  
Self Paced  
Blended  
Classroom  
Virtual Classroom  
Activity

To rename the terminologies, follow these steps.

1. As an Administrator, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL General]** > **[!UICONTROL Product Terminology]**. The product terminology option opens. 

   ![](assets/product-terminology.png)

   *Rename product terminology*

1. Changes can be made by uploading a modified product terminology template by downloading the sample CSV file. To download the sample CSV file, click on the **[!UICONTROL Download here]** option.
1. The downloaded CSV file contains the name of the objects in coloum A. In coloumn B, choose the name you want to assign to the respective object. Note that you need to update the singular and plural form of the name separated by a (|).
1. You can choose to modify one or more rows. You can either retain the non-modified rows or remove them from the CSV file before uploading them.
1. Upload the modified CSV file and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**. Learning Manager refreshes reflecting your changes.
1. To reset to default terminologies, click **[!UICONTROL Reset Product Terminology]**.

   ![](assets/with-reset-option.png)

   *Reset the product terminologies*

## Profile settings {#profilesettings}

1. Click the drop-down arrow at the upper-right corner, adjacent to your photo/account and choose **[!UICONTROL Profile Settings]**.
1. From the pop-up dialog, you can add/change a photo by hovering the mouse and by clicking **[!UICONTROL Edit]** in the profile photo area.
1. Add/modify **[!UICONTROL About]** content by clicking **[!UICONTROL Edit]** adjacent to it. 
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Save].**

## Content Folder {#content-folder}

Learning Manager supports private content folders. An Administrator can configure private content folders and provide its access to specific custom-authors using Custom Roles. Note that Standard Authors (also called as Full Authors) continue to have access to all the content in the account. Hence Full Authors have access to all folders and all the content. 

Content Folders can be configured by Administrators. Only once configured, content folders become visible to authors and they get an ability to place the content in one or multiple folders. 

To add a content folder, in the Administrator app, click **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL Content Folder]**.

![](assets/manage-content-folders.png)

*Change Content Folder settings*

### Folder

A folder is a repository of content, which is a subset of the entire content library available in an account with the following properties:

* Only an Admin can create, edit, or delete a folder.
* An Admin can control access to folders as part of defining roles only for custom admins.  
* Content **must at all times, be associated with at least one folder**. To start with, all content will be associated with the Public folder, which can later be changed.
* Content can be associated with multiple folders at the time of creation, which will also be possible by a copy operation
* All folder names must be unique within the account, otherwise there will be an error in naming a folder.

Folders only control visibility of content and don't create copies of content. Therefore, editing content will reflect in all the associated folders.

### Public folder

A public folder is always present in an account and initially, all content will be part of this folder. Later, authors can move content out of this folder into other folders. A public folder has the following properties:

* All content associated with this folder will be accessible to all types of authors, by default.
* Any content that is a part of a public folder, cannot be part of any other folder. The converse also holds true.

This folder cannot be part of configurable role definition. Consequently, not having a public folder in configurable role definition doesn't restrict access to a public folder.

### Private folder

* Any folder created by an Admin is a private folder.

### Folder operations

**Add a folder**

To add a folder, click **[!UICONTROL Add]** on the upper-right corner of the window.

**Delete a folder**

You can also delete a folder. Select the folder to delete, click the Actions menu, and click **[!UICONTROL Delete Folder]**.

>[!NOTE]
>
>Folders can be deleted when all of its associated content is also associated with other folders. If there is content that is linked with only the folder being deleted, first move the content to another folder, and then delete the folder.

## Classroom locations

Administrators can use this setting to create and configure a library of classroom locations. Authors can select a pre-configured location to set up their classroom event. Select a location from the library to automatically populate the location information, URL, and seat limit. 

As an admin, you can either:

### Import locations CSV

Add locations in your account by importing a CSV file of locations. The CSV file must contain the column City.

### Add a location

Add the following:

1. Location Name: Enter the name of the classroom.
2. Location Information: Enter the information about the location.
3. Location Region: The entered value appears as Training Locations filter for learners.
4. Location URL: Enter the URL of the location.
5. Seat Limit: Enter the seating capacity of the room.

![classroom location](assets/location-alm.gif)

*Add classroom locations*

You can also add the location with the help of a CSV. The CSV must contain the fields:

* name
* info
* url
* seatlimit
* region

<!--![Add classroom locations](assets/add-classroom-csv.png)-->
