With the integration of Adobe Learning Manager and Adobe Connect for creating virtual classroom modules or sessions, your Connect account should support Meeting rooms with adequate number of rooms and concurrent users for your use case. These meeting rooms are used to host Learning Manager virtual classroom modules. A new Connect meeting room is dynamically created by Prime for each virtual classroom module or session within Prime.

You must purchase Adobe Connect separately, apart from Adobe Learning Manager.

If the host of Virtual classroom course do not attend the session, then attendance does not register automatically for learners who attended the session. In such scenarios, Administrator can record&nbsp;the attendance manually.

Click the virtual classroom course, click&nbsp;Attendance&nbsp;on the left pane of the following page and record the attendance.
