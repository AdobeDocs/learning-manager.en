# Group Success Dashboard

The Group Success Dashboard offers an efficient and user-friendly way for admins and managers to monitor and track their teams' training progress.

Group Success Dashboard offers the following:

* **Simplifies learner progress tracking**: The dashboard offers an alternative to the Excel-based learner transcript, allowing for easier and quicker access to information about learners' course enrollments and progress. 
* **Facilitates team management**: The dashboard is particularly useful for managers overseeing small teams, enabling them to frequently check their team members' learning progress on specific courses or learning paths.

Managers (or store managers) handling small teams (less than 50 people) can use the GSD to regularly check how their team is progressing with their courses. This is helpful for quick updates and making sure everyone is completing their training.
The Group Success Dashboard makes it easier to track learner progress. Instead of using Excel files, managers and admins can use the dashboard to quickly see course enrollments and progress.

Admins can create dashboards by giving them a name, selecting user groups, and choosing the courses or learning paths. The dashboards can be shared with other admins or managers.
