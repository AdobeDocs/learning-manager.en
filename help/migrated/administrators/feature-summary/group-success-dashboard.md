# Group Success Dashboard

The Group Success Dashboard helps administrators and managers track learner engagement, training completion, and skill development at a team level. 

The dashboard offers aggregated insights across various business units, regions, departments, or custom groups, enabling targeted learning interventions and strategic decisions. 

The Group Success Dashboard is utilized by organizations for a variety of purposes. HR teams monitor the onboarding process for new hires and identify any necessary support. Learning and Development leaders compare training completion rates across different regions. Compliance teams ensure that finance employees meet certification requirements. Sales training managers track the completion of product training before launches, while talent development teams monitor the adoption of leadership learning paths among mid-level managers for succession planning.

Group Success Dashboard offers the following:

* **Simplifies learner progress tracking**: The dashboard offers an alternative to the Excel-based learner transcript, allowing for easier and quicker access to information about learners' course enrollments and progress. 
* **Facilitates team management**: The dashboard is particularly useful for managers overseeing small teams, enabling them to frequently check their team members' learning progress on specific courses or learning paths.

Managers (or store managers) handling small teams (less than 50 people) can use the GSD to regularly check how their team is progressing with their courses. This is helpful for quick updates and making sure everyone is completing their training.
The Group Success Dashboard makes it easier to track learner progress. Instead of using Excel files, managers and administrators can use the dashboard to quickly see course enrollments and progress.

Administrator can create dashboards by giving them a name, selecting user groups, and choosing the courses or learning paths. The dashboards can be shared with other administrators or managers.
