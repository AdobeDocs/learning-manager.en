## Overview of Group Success Dashboard

The Group Success Dashboard (GSD) allows admins and managers to track learner progress in real time, including enrollment status, pending actions, and course completion. It provides an easy way to monitor learning for user groups organized by departments, business units, or regions, helping identify and support learners who need help.
