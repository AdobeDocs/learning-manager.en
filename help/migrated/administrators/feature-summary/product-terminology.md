## What is Product Terminology in Adobe Learning Manager

Adobe Learning Manager uses a standard set of terminologies on the User Interface. As an Administrator, you can modify the terminologies to match your organization's needs.

Using the Product Terminology feature, you can rename these terminologies, and be consistent with your organization's learning standards.

## Download the terminology csv file

To change the terminologies, follow the steps below:

1. As an Administrator, select **[!UICONTROL Settings]** > **[!UICONTROL General]**.
1. In the **[!UICONTROL Product Terminology]**, select **[!UICONTROL Edit]**.

1. Select **[!UICONTROL Download Here]** and download the template of the terminologies.

## Change the terminologies

1. After downloading the CSV, change the required terminologies in the second column. For example, you can change Module to Training or Leaderboard to Ranking.
