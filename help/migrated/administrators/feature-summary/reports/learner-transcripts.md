In case of learners, they must launch their profile settings and then download their learning transcripts as an Excel file. This transcript, generated for an individual learner, details their personal learning journey. It includes the names of learning paths, courses, instances, and modules, along with key dates like enrollment, completion, and deadlines. It also tracks their progress through status, grades, quiz scores (including highest scores and maximums), and attempts taken. Additionally, it shows training IDs, durations, unenrollment dates, prices, and any submission comments. This report provides a comprehensive overview of a single learner's engagement and performance.

Organizations may use the Learner Transcripts to add the learning behavior data to an enterprise data warehouse, where one may want to combine learning data with other enterprise data to analyze correlations between learning behavior and other process data.
