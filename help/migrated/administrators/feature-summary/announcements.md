# Announcements {#announcements}

An announcement is a multimedia message (text, image or video) that an Administrator broadcasts to a defined set of users.

Administrator can broadcast announcements to learners informing them about the occurrence of an event or an activity.&nbsp;Announcement can be a combination of text, images, or&nbsp;videos. You can link learning objects like courses, learning programs and certifications to an announcement.

There are three types of announcements:

* Notification
* Masthead
* Recommendation

## Notification {#notification}

1. As an Administrator user, click&nbsp;Announcements&nbsp;at the left pane.
1. Click&nbsp;Add&nbsp;at the upper-right corner of the page.
1. From the Type drop-down list, select the option **As Notification**.
1. In the Message field, add the message for the announcement. You can also add a URL for announcements here. However, you must add the URL in the HTML form.&nbsp;

   For example,  `code <a href="http://www.w3schools.com" target="_blank">Visit W3Schools</a>.`

   When you specify the target as blank, then when a user clicks the announcement URL, the link opens in a new tab. If you do not specify the target, the link opens in the same browser.

1. Optionally add attachments such as images or video files for the announcement.
1. Choose the target user groups or the target learning objects. You can choose only one of them for an announcement.

   Start typing the user group name in the text box and choose from the drop-down list. Similarly, choose the training by typing the object name in the text-box.

1. Click&nbsp;Advanced Settings&nbsp;from the dialog box. You can perform the following actions:

   * Make this announcement a sticky announcement by selecting the Enable Sticky Announcement checkbox.
   * Select the delivery time for the announcement.

1. Choose&nbsp;**On a date**&nbsp;if you want to schedule announcement for a later date and click the text area adjacent to it. A calendar pop-up appears, from which you can choose the start date. Choose the end date by following the same steps.
1. Click **Save.**
1. In Drafts tab, click settings icon&nbsp;&nbsp;adjacent to an announcement and click&nbsp;send.

If the multimedia attachment is of large size, it may take time to upload. After you click&nbsp;Save,&nbsp;you would receive a pop-up with a message as your upload is being processed. You will receive a notification after the attachment is uploaded successfully.
