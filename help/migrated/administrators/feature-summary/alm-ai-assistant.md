# Admin AI Assistant (Beta) in Adobe Learning Manager

In complex learning setups, administrators may struggle to find content or complete tasks because of complicated menus and disconnected workflows. Tasks like running reports or accessing specific information can require navigating multiple screens. The Admin AI Assistant helps you find the right information to understand and complete tasks efficiently.

The Admin AI Assistant (Beta) in Adobe Learning Manager provides a smart, conversational way for administrators to quickly find answers and get helpful suggestions to perform tasks more easily.

It uses Adobe's AI capabilities to enable natural language queries across learning content and system workflows.  Administrators can ask questions like **How to add users to Adobe Learning Manager** or **How to add Learning Paths**. The Adobe Learning Manager Admin AI Assistant is trained only on publicly available, Adobe-owned documentation such as **[!UICONTROL Experience League]** resources. It does not learn from or access customer content, internal training material, or user-generated data.

This assistant reduces reliance on manual navigation, shortens discovery time, and helps surface actionable insights quickly.

<!--## Key benefits
