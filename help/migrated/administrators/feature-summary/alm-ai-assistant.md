# AI Assistant (Beta) in Adobe Learning Manager: Helping administrators work smarter

In complex learning environments, administrators often face challenges locating relevant content or performing routine tasks because of deeply nested menus and fragmented workflows. Tasks like running reports or accessing specific information can require navigating multiple screens. The AI Assistant simplifies this experience by providing an intelligent conversational interface that streamlines content discovery and reporting in Adobe Learning Manager, improving speed, accuracy, and ease of use.

The AI Assistant (Beta) in Adobe Learning Manager offers a smart, conversational way to help administrators get answers faster, receive suggestions, and execute key tasks without leaving the platform. 

It uses Adobe's AI capabilities to enable natural language queries across learning content and system workflows.  Administrators can ask questions like **How to add users to Adobe Learning Manager** or **How to add Learning Paths**. The ALM AI Assistant is trained only on publicly available, Adobe-owned documentation such as **[!UICONTROL Experience League]** resources. It does not learn from or access customer content, internal training material, or user-generated data.

This assistant reduces reliance on manual navigation, shortens discovery time, and helps surface actionable insights quickly.

<!--## Key benefits

* Perform common administrator tasks faster with conversational guidance.
* Get instant answers without browsing through extensive menus.
* Gain real-time insights and step-by-step guidance for administrative workflows.-->
