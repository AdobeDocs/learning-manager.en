# Reports

Learn about the Reports associated with Administrator role in Learning Manager application.

Adobe Learning Manager enables you to create varied reports to track, monitor, and control learner activities. Learners activities are tracked and captured automatically into the database. Manager and Administrator reports are generated from the database.

## Overview {#overview}

Reports generation process is similar for both Administrator and Manager. Managers can view reports corresponding to their subordinates whereas Administrator can view all organization-wide reports.

Reports are aggregated in a dashboard. A report has to exist inside a dashboard. A **Default Dashboard** exists by default in the reports page. Any report added by you moves into this default dashboard. To add reports to individual dashboards, use the drop-down arrow and choose **Add Report**. For more information on creating dashboards, refer to Dashboards section on this page.

## Learning Summary dashboards {#dashboards}

See a summary report of all the learning activities in the platform. On this page, you can see the following summary information for the selected root user's team and external profiles. Time range can also be selected:

* Learning Summary in form of Enrollments, Views, and Completions
* Top skills
* Compliance summary 

![](assets/summary-charts.png)
*Summary charts*

If there are internal root level managers, they will be displayed one after another. 

All external profiles will be listed after internal profiles (Internal root level users).

If an external profile has a manager, then the manager hierarchy will be displayed in the **Showing Data For** drop-down list. - User will be listed in manager hierarchy in all the details page (Learning summary, compliance, and skill status)

If not, then all individual user details will be displayed in the list.

To see more granular details of enrollments of various internal teams, click **Learning Summary Details**.

![](assets/learning-sunnarydetails.png)
*Learning Summary details*

When you click any enrollment, you can see the learners for each manager, and enrollment to which Learning Objects. You can also see the progression and completion details of each learner. 

![](assets/learners-for-a-manager.png)
*Learners for a manager*

Click any team and export its report as a csv. An Admin can export the report for any of the User Group or individual user by selecting the User Group or individual user, and then export details from the Action drop-down list.

Also, you can see a bar chart view of skills that are in progress and have been achieved. You can add/remove skills that you want to feature in the graph.

![](assets/skill-status-stackedbarchart.png)
*Skill status stacked bar chart*

In the final visualization, you can check the compliance status of learners, and take appropriate action.

Also, an Admin can view individual training data in the Compliance Dashboard.

For instance, the Administrator has identified three trainings to track compliance. Learning Manager provides the compliance snapshot for all three trainings at once.

Now an Admin can click on any training and quickly view the compliance for the selected training.

![](assets/compliance-dashboard.png)
*Compliance dashboard*

You can also see the compliance status for each internal team.

Click the link **Compliance Status Details** on the bottom of the visualization. 

You can see that, for a team, the number of learners in the team are violating or honoring the learning compliance.

![](assets/compliance-statusofateam.png)
*Compliance status of a team*

## Share training with managers

Learning Manager offers compliance dashboard to all Administrators and Managers. Managers find it very useful to track compliance of their team members for a particular training. At the same time, Administrators would like all Managers to add compliance trainings to their dashboard and track it. 

In Learning Manager, the **Share with Managers** workflow allows Administrators to share training with Managers, so that they can get added to a manager's Compliance Dashboard. Thus, Managers do not need to take any action and can start tracking compliance immediately. 

An Administrator can share a set of training courses with managers individually or with a group. This sharing can help a manager easily track the compliance of his/her team for the specified training.

The Administrator can "push" a default list of compliance training to be viewed in the manager's compliance dashboard.

### Share training

1. In **Reports** > **Learning Summary**, scroll down, and click the tab **Share with Managers**. 

   ![](assets/share-with-managers.png)
   *Share training with managers*

1. To add training or multiple training, click **Share more**.   

1. In the **Share with Managers** dialog, choose the training(s) and the manager(s).

   ![](assets/select-training.png)
   *Select training to share with managers*

1. Click **Share**.

The training is now shared with the specified manager.

### View training

In the list of shared training, click **View**. You can view the training that is assigned to a manager or some managers.

### Withdraw training

1. To withdraw training from a manager, click **Withdraw**.  

1. Click **Proceed**. This withdraws previously shared training from the Manager's compliance dashboard.

## User Activity dashboards {#useractivitydashboards}

See a summary of all user activity on the platform over time. Configure user groups and apply filters.

The user activity dashboard displays the activity of users in the account. The three reports that are listed are:

* **Registered Users:** This report provides information of the number of users registered in your account week over week. For accounts with Monthly Active Units licensing, the report shows the MAU units instead.

* **User Visits Report:** This report provides information about the number of users accessing the platform on a day to day basis. Monthly report is also available.

* **Learning Time Spent Report:** This report provides information about the Learning Time Spent in the platform on a day to day basis. Monthly report is also available.

## Registered Users {#registeredusers}

Learning Manager records the number of users registered in the system every week. Administrators can view this report to understand the registered count of users on that day of the week. Registered count once stored for a week does not change. Hence historical registered count is not related to the current set of learners in the system. 

This report provides information of the number of users registered in your account week over week.

For accounts with Monthly Active Units licensing, the report shows the MAU units instead.

![](assets/registered-usersreport.png)
*Registered Users report*

***For Monthly Access Unit accounts:***

**Monthly Active Users report**

This report shows the count of learner active in the learning platform each month. User is considered active for the month if he/she performs any of the learning actions mentioned here. It is the same way Monthly Active Units are counted.

The monthly active count once counted and stored for a month, does not change. Hence the historical count displayed is not related to the current set of learners in the system.

## User Visits {#uservisits}

This report shows the total learners accessing the system in a day or month period. Browsing the learning platform without consuming any learning is also considered as 'accessing' the learning platform. This helps the Administrator understand the total set of users accessing the system. On the first of the month, Learning Manager creates a record of total users accessing the platform for the previous month. It also captures the usergroup information for these users.

Only those usergroups configured by the Administrator are recorded. This allows the Administrators to apply filter on usergroups for historical monthly data as well. Note that incase usergroups configuration is modified and Learning Manager has not recorded data for this usergroup in earlier months, then Learning Manager cannot display the data for this newly configured usergroups for previous months. 

This report contains users accessing the platform using all formats like web, mobile app, headless custom solutions, and so on. The device app usage graph specifically mentions only the users accessing the platform using Learning Manager's device app. This helps Administrators identify the usage of mobile app in their account. 

![](assets/user-visit-report.png)
*User Visit report*

## Learning Time Spent Report {#learningtimespentreport}

Here, you can see a dual-axis line charts that show total learning time spent for all learners across a 12-month period. The second axis represent the median time spent in learning for an individual.

The time spent for different Learning Objects, such as, Learning Programs and Certifications, is calculated for the following:

* Self-paced course with static and interactive content
* Activity courses with url.
* Weekend sessions with the weekend flag enabled. 
* VC connect session where attendance is auto marked.
* The time spent for different Learning Objects, such as, Learning Programs and Certifications
* xAPI statements for an xAPI activity course.

You can further export the graph as an Excel spreadsheet.

A filter to choose User group configuration is provided which will help in viewing the data with respect to different user groups.

The selected date and user group filter is applied to all the relevant graphs in the dashboard. 

>[!NOTE]
>
>For **User Visits** and **Learning Time Spent** reports, the default data (when no user group is configured) shown will be for the entire account.

## Training Content dashboard {#trainingcontentdashboard}

The Training content dashboard offers insights into trainings available on the platform. You can view popular trainings or track all available trainings. 

## Trainings Report {#trainingsreport}

This report provides information of the total trainings available in the platform (in published state) month over month. It gives an indication of the number of trainings offered over time. 

![](assets/training-report.png)
*Training report*

## Active Trainings Report {#activetrainingsreport}

This report provides information of the trainings which are active over the selected time range. Active trainings are trainings which are enrolled, viewed in player, or completed in the given time.

For active trainings, data of all root user (with manager role) internal groups will be available for selection when no user group configuration is done. Apart from the root user user groups, you can configure 10 more user groups if needed.

![](assets/active-trainingsreport.png)
