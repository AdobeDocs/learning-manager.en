While creating a skill, an Administrator can map it with the most relevant skill domains that Learning Manager supports. This will further be considered in Auto Curation process. Learning Manager LMS lists the following skills:

* Supply chain management

Depending on whether the content being uploaded has a confidence score of more than 50%, the content gets uploaded in the board. If your content meets the criteria, then you get to see a notification that says that the content has been successfully curated and is now available in the board.
