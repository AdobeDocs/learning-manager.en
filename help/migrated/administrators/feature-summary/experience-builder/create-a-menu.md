# Organize pages into a menu

Menus help organize and link pages in Experience Builder, making it easy for learners to navigate your learning portal. Administrators can create menus, add pages to them, and customize which menus are shown to specific audiences. 

## Create a menu

To create a menu:

1. Log in to Adobe Learning Manager as an administrator.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Branding]** in the left navigation pane.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Menu]** and then select **[!UICONTROL Create]**.

4. Type the **[!UICONTROL Menu name]** (for example, Product Training) and select the user group in the **[!UICONTROL Visible to]** option.

5. Choose the custom page from the **[!UICONTROL Select pages]** option.

6. Select **[!UICONTROL Preview menu]** to view the menu before saving it. 
7. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

The created menu will be visible for the selected learners. They can access the custom pages through their Learner UI.

## Set up hidden pages

The hide pages option allows administrators to keep the Learner UI clean by showing fewer pages. Administrators can hide pages from the menu so learners don't see them in learner UI, but learners can still reach those pages in other ways. For example, the Catalog page can be hidden from the menu but accessed through other navigation paths.
