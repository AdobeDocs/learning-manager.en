## Overview

A page in Experience Builder is a customizable space that serves as the foundation for organizing and presenting learning content, resources, and interactive elements within your learning portal. It acts as a digital canvas where administrators can arrange various widgets, such as course lists, events calendars, compliance status, banners, and social feed. 
Brand each page with corporate colors, logos, and themes, and tailor it to specific user groups or audiences such as new hires, managers, or external partners. Pages move through a lifecycle from draft to published (or archived) and may be made visible via navigational menus or accessible through direct links. Altogether, pages in Experience Builder allow organizations to design dynamic, engaging, and role-specific learning experiences that drive meaningful engagement and smooth access to needed resources.

## Create your first page

Imagine a financial services company with specific training requirements for its Sales and Customer Success teams. Using Experience Builder, the organization creates dedicated, branded learning pages tailored to each group's needs.

* **Sales team page**: The Sales department's learning page highlights the latest product training modules, regulatory compliance courses, up-to-date pitch materials, and an embedded leaderboard widget to encourage healthy competition. Sales users landing on this page immediately see content and resources targeted to improving their specific skills and business performance. 

* **Customer Success team page**: Meanwhile, the Customer Success team's learning page displays certifications in customer service, troubleshooting guides, scenario-based courses, a calendar of upcoming client onboarding workshops, and a social feed for sharing tips. This ensures the Customer Success team accesses content relevant to enhancing client satisfaction and support excellence.

By using role-based pages, each department experiences a personalized, distraction-free learning portal, vastly increasing the relevance and impact of their training. This approach encourages compliance, supports onboarding, and encourages ongoing skill development in a way that directly maps to each team's core objectives and workflows.
