# Overview

Experience Builder allows administrators to create tailored learner experiences within the platform, bridging the gap between out-of-the-box native interfaces and fully headless solutions. It allows for the design of custom pages using a variety of widgets, flexible menu configurations, and advanced branding through CSS and JavaScript. This approach reduces time-to-market and implementation costs compared to headless builds, while still offering deep customization for branding and layout.

## What you can customize

**Footer**

You have two options for the footer. You can use the Default Footer, which is configured in the general admin settings, or you can select a Custom Footer. The custom option allows you to input your own HTML and CSS, giving you complete control over the footer's design and content to match your brand.

**Global CSS and JS configuration**

Customize the learner app's appearance and functionality by injecting custom CSS and JavaScript. This allows precise branding, dynamic UI changes, and advanced interactive features.

**Course tile**

Globally configure which details appear on the Learning Object cards across the entire account. You can show or hide elements, such as the author's name, skill name, rating, description, and the enroll button. However, core metadata like the title, image, price, and progress bar cannot be removed.

**Widgets**

Customize widgets in Experience Builder by selecting from a variety of widget types (e.g., calendar, categories, courses and paths, custom content box, gamification, HTML, iFrame, social learning, my learning) and configuring their properties, layout, and content. Widgets support custom titles, descriptions, images, actions, and in some cases, advanced options like injecting HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for dynamic or API-driven experiences.

## Use cases

**Create role-based, personalized learning portals**

Provide different experiences to different learners within the same account, such as creating custom pages and menus or a curated learning strip for a particular audience.

Additionally, designate a published custom page as the landing page for a specific user group. This ensures that when learners from that group log in, they are immediately directed to a relevant, custom-built experience instead of the default homepage.

**Build event-specific learning pages**

Experience Builder is ideal for creating temporary, focused learning experiences for corporate events or time-sensitive initiatives.

* **Corporate events**: For an event like a "Design Summit," an administrator can create new pages specifically for the design team. These pages can include session information, speaker lists, and pre-event training materials. The Calendar widget is particularly useful here, as it can be added to the page to display upcoming sessions and allow attendees to register and track them.
* **Time-bound campaigns**: Create a temporary campaign, such as a two-month "Sales Kick-Off". For this period, a custom homepage and menu can be made visible only to the sales team, featuring a banner like "Sales Kick Off 2026" and courses specific to their strategy for the new fiscal year. After two months, the portal can revert to the standard experience for everyone. This allows for the creation of targeted "micro learning campaigns".

**Develop branded customer academies**

Experience Builder allows companies to build on-brand customer training portals without the high cost and long development time of a fully headless implementation.

For maximum flexibility, the HTML widget, for example, allows you to embed custom HTML, CSS, and JS code for elements like testimonials or uniquely styled banners. This gives you more control over the branding experience.

**Integrate custom content**

Configure menus to appear in different locations (left rail, top nav, below header) and control page visibility for streamlined user journeys.

* **Create rich content sections**: The Content Box widget allows you to easily create sections with titles, descriptions, images, and calls-to-action (CTAs) to guide learners or highlight key information.
* **Encourage collaboration and competition**: You can add the Social Learning widget to display posts and comments or the Gamification widget to show leaderboards and points directly on a custom page, driving engagement.
* **Organize content for easy navigation**: Use the Categories widget to display catalogues, products, or roles as a strip of tiles, providing learners with clear, visual navigation paths to different content areas.
Integrate external tools
* **Embed external applications**: The iFrame widget allows you to embed external web applications or webpages directly within a custom page, creating a smoother experience for the learner.
* **Create dynamic components with APIs**: The HTML widget allows you to add JavaScript to allow users to interact with, for example, learner APIs. Using this approach, you can create experience within the native Learning Manager environment without needing to build a new application.
