# Overview

Widgets are modular, configurable content blocks or functional elements in Adobe Learning Manager's Experience Builder.
They provide the core building blocks of your custom learning pages, allowing you to easily add learning content, interactive features, branding elements, and integrations without code.

## How are widgets used

**Select a widget**

After selecting a layout for your page (for example, a single or two-column layout), you'll see an **[!UICONTROL Add widget]** button in each empty column. Selecting this brings up a list of available widgets to choose from.

**Configure a widget**

Each widget has its own set of configuration options. This typically involves providing a mandatory title and an optional description. Beyond that, you configure widget-specific settings, such as selecting a catalog for the Categories widget or uploading an image for the Content Box widget.

**Arrange widgets**

You can easily reposition widgets on the page by dragging or dropping the widgets to move them between different columns or rows.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A single page can contain a maximum of 25 widgets. When this limit is reached, a warning message appears, and the **[!UICONTROL Add widget]** buttons become disabled.


## Types of widgets

* Learning-based widgets, which are dynamic and pull data directly from Adobe Learning Manager (for example, Courses & Paths, Compliance Status).
* Static or content widgets, which help you create custom branding and add flexible content to a page (for example, HTML, Content Box)
