# Core components of Experience Builder

Experience Builder is built on three core components: pages, widgets, and menus. Administrators can create custom pages using flexible layouts, add dynamic and static content through a library of widgets, and create navigation menus targeted to specific audiences.

## Pages

Pages are the foundation of building a learning portal in Experience Builder. Administrators can create new pages tailored to specific audiences or purposes. Additionally, administrators can:

* Create custom pages with flexible layouts (rows and columns).
* Add widgets to populate pages with content.
* Manage page lifecycle with draft and published states.
* Hide pages from menus while keeping them accessible via direct links.

For example, a page for sales training might include widgets displaying relevant courses, testimonials, and a calendar of upcoming sessions.

## Menus

Menus organize pages into navigable structures for learners. Administrators can:

* Create custom menus to group pages for specific user groups.
* Add hierarchy and ordering to prioritize visibility for specific audiences.
* Include submenus for grouping related pages.

For example, a menu called Resources might include pages for eBooks, videos, and FAQs.

## Widgets

Widgets allow administrators to add dynamic content and functionality to pages. The following widgets are available:

* Calendar
* Categories
* Compliance Status
* Courses & Paths
* Content Box
* Gamification
* HTML
* Iframe
* My Learning
* Social Learning

For example, a page might include a Courses & Paths widget to display recommended courses and a Calendar widget for upcoming training sessions.

## Branding tools

Experience Builder provides tools to customize the appearance of the portal. Administrators can:

* Customize headers, footers, and layouts to match corporate branding.
* Use CSS and JavaScript for advanced styling.

For example, a healthcare company might use branding tools to create a portal that matches their corporate website's look and feel.
