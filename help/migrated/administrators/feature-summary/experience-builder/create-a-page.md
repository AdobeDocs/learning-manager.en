# Create a custom page in Experience Builder

As an administrator at a financial services company, you manage two teams: Sales and Customer Success. Each team has unique learning requirements, but both have been using the same standard learning portal. This has led to confusion, clutter, and low learner engagement.
To solve this challenge without investing in a headless build or waiting for a custom developer solution, you can use Experience Builder in Adobe Learning Manager. With pages, widgets, and menus, you can design branded, role-specific portals in just a few steps, without coding.

To create a custom page for Sales Engineering team in Adobe Learning Manager:

1. Log in to Adobe Learning Manager as an administrator. 
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Branding]** in the left navigation pane. 
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Custom Pages]**.
4. Select **[!UICONTROL Create page]**.

7. Select the page type from the following:

   * **[!UICONTROL Build using ALM widgets]**: Administrator can create a page using the existing Adobe Learning Manager widgets. Type the custom string in the Page URL field. This string will be appended to your custom page's URL.
   * **[!UICONTROL External page]**: The administrator can add a URL for the external page. If you select the page type as external, type the external page URL in the Page URL text field.

8. Select the **[!UICONTROL Change icon]** to change the page's icon.
9. Select **[!UICONTROL Add New Language]** to add the default language for the page. 
10. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**. 

The page has been created and saved as a draft in the Custom Pages section. Administrators can edit and design the drafted pages using the widgets. 

The next step is to add a layout to the custom page, where you can add and configure widgets.

## Page layout in Experience Builder

Design your page by selecting the appropriate section layout from the dropdown menu. The maximum width for any layout is 1212 pixels. Choose from the following section options based on how many widgets you want to add and their desired size:

* **[!UICONTROL 1 column - Full section width]**: The content spans the entire width of the section, providing maximum space.
* **[!UICONTROL 2 columns - 1/2 section width each]**: The section is split evenly into two equal-width columns.
* **[!UICONTROL 2 columns - 2/3 and 1/3 section width]**: The main content occupies two-thirds of the width, while side content uses one-third.
* **[!UICONTROL 2 columns - 1/3 and 2/3 section width]**: Side content takes one-third, and main content takes two-thirds of the section.
* **[!UICONTROL 3 columns - 1/3 section width each]**: The section divides into three equal-width columns.

>[!NOTE]
>
>A maximum of 10 widgets can be added vertically in all layouts, except the 1 column - Full section width layout.
