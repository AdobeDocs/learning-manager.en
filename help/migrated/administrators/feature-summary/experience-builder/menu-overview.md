# Overview

Menus in Experience Builder are customizable navigation structures that you create to organize pages and deliver a tailored and personalized learning experience to specific audiences. They are a core component of Experience Builder, along with pages and widgets, and are the primary mechanism for controlling what different learners see and how they navigate the portal.

## How are menus used

Use menus to control the entire navigation journey for learners. The configuration options allow for deep customization and user group targeting.

**Audience targeting**

Create and assign a menu to one or more user groups. This is the core of personalization; only learners belonging to the assigned group(s) will see that specific menu.

**Customize menu**

Select which pages appear in each menu, order them, and name menus for clarity and branding ("Onboarding," "Manager Tools," "Sales Training," and so on.)

**Create nested menus**

Group pages hierarchically using the main menus and submenus for deeper navigation (for example, "Products" menu with pages for "Product A" and "Product B").

**Custom landing page**

Assign any published custom page as the landing page for that menu. This means when learners from that user group log in, they will be directed to your custom page instead of the default Home or Social Learning page.

**Control page visibility**

Hide specific pages from the navigation bar. A hidden page is not visible in the learner's UI but can still be accessed through direct links or redirection from widgets.

## Use cases of menus

**Role-based learning portals**

This is where different departments get entirely different learning experiences. For example, a financial organization can create a dedicated menu for its Sales team and another for its Customer Success team. The Sales menu might link to pages with compliance training and product updates, while the Customer Success menu might direct learners to pages focused on communication training, ensuring each employee sees content that is relevant to their role.

**Event-specific learning experiences**

Use menus to create temporary, targeted portals for specific events. For example, during a company's annual Sales Kick Off, you can create a special menu visible only to the sales team for a limited time (e.g., two months). This menu would lead to pages containing the event schedules, pre-event training, and speaker lists, providing a focused experience that reverts to the standard view after the event concludes.

**Micro-learning campaigns**

Build a custom menu and a set of pages targeted at a specific audience for a short-term campaign. This allows you to deliver a highly focused set of learning materials without disrupting the experience for the rest of the organization.
