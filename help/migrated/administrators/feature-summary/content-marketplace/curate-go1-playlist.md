# Curate Go1 courses to a Learning Path

Administrators often need to curate courses from multiple repositories or catalogs, which makes it hard to identify the best options. This is especially challenging with Go1, where thousands of courses are available. To simplify this, we provide an AI-powered curation feature directly within the Learning Path creation flow. This helps admins quickly discover and select the most relevant courses

Add Go1 courses directly to Learning Paths and certifications. Create Learning Paths that include a Go1 courses, so learners can access selected Go1 courses as part of their training.

## Course limit exceeded

When adding Go1 courses to a Learning Path, administrators may see an error if the newly added courses have not yet been synced to Adobe Learning Manager. These courses will be available within 48 to 72 hours.

If you add the playlist now, only the courses that are already synced will be included.

To include all courses, it is recommended to wait until the sync is complete before adding the playlist to a Learning Path.

## Go1 courses in certifications

Administrators can add Go1 courses in certification programs within Adobe Learning Manager. While creating a certification, administrators can search and select courses from the Go1 content catalog. All Go1 courses imported through the Go1 plan are available for selection within the certification workflow.

Certifications that include Go1 courses can be configured as either perpetual or recurring. In the case of recurring certifications, the certificate automatically renews after the defined time interval, allowing learners to retake the Go1 courses and maintain their certification status.
