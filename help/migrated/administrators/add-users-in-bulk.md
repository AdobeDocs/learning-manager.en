## CSV upload with mandatory fields {#csvuploadwithmandatoryfields}

It is not mandatory to add user's profile and Manager's email-id in the CSV. User name and the user's email-id are the only mandatory fields.

In this case, by default your company's Administrator is treated as the Manager for users. By default, employee is considered as user's profile.

**Sample CSV**

Captivate Prime sample CSV is available below with mandatory fields.

## CSV upload with all the fields {#csvuploadwithallthefields}

Before including Manager's email-id for any employee, ensure that the Manager is first added as an employee in CSV. For example, refer to the employee name, Howard Walters in the snapshot below:

Also, Administrators of an organization can add themselves as employees and mention their Manager's email-id as root.
