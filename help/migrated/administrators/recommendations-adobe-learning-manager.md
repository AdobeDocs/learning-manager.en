# Overview

Adobe Learning Manager has introduced a new and revamped recommendation system for courses. This recommendations feature uses AI algorithms and users' interests like Products, Roles, and Levels to provide personalized content recommendations.

The new recommendations system allows you to create custom parameters that learners can select to receive personalized recommendations. These recommendations will be displayed as Courses, Learning Paths, and Certifications to learners on their homepage feed.

To get started with this feature, you must enable the feature in the Admin app.  

## Enable and configure the recommendations

Upload the course and user data (optional). 

Make the changes live. 

After enabling and configuring the recommendations, you upload the data into Adobe Learning Manager for recommendations to start working. This data comprises of

* Course data
* User data (optional)

## Course ranking algorithm

The core of the recommendation engine is driven by Learning Manager's new **Course Ranking Algorithm**. The algorithm uses **50 million data points** and **five years of aggregated learning data across millions of users** to rank courses based on their **likelihood of enrolment**. This ranking ensures that most enrollable courses are displayed upfront to the learners.

## Key terms

Learning Manager's new AI-based recommendation engine provides learning leaders with a configurable **parameter-based** recommendation system for crafting a personalized experience for learners.

The parameters areâ€”**Products/topics, Roles, and Levels**. Additionally, these parameters can be renamed to suit your needs. So, 'products' can become 'topics' or 'roles' can become 'region'.

## Set up the recommendation system

Adobe Learning Manager's new recommendation engine simplifies the Admin workflow involved in setting up personalized recommendations because data about Products and Roles associated with a customer/partner is typically available to Admins (for example, from purchase records).

There are primarily three workflows involved in setting up the new recommendation engine:

* Admin
* Author
* Learner

Admins configure the account's Products, Roles, and Levels parameter values. For example, an IT solutions provider with banks as their primary customer base may configure the "Product" parameter to have values such as Payment Gateway, Secure Cloud Storage, Fraud Detection System, Trading Platform etc., and the "Role" Parameter to have values such as Integration Specialist, Network Administrator, Risk Analyst, Compliance Officer, etc.

Admins are provided a guided workflow in Learning Manager to optimally set up the recommendation engine and customize the engine based on the account's use case. Additionally, Admins also get the option of setting up PRL recommendations via a one-time CSV upload.
