# View learner's response to an outlook calendar invite on Learning Manager {#view-learners-response-to-an-outlook-calendar-invite-on-learning-manager}

Learn how an admin and an instructor can view a learner's response to a calendar invite.

In Learning Manager, when a learner is enrolled to a Virtual Class/Class Room session in a course, the learner gets a detailed outlook calendar invite. 

A learner's response to the session invite is recorded in Learning Manager and the admin and the instructor can view the details. 

If a learner responds to the same invite more than once, then the latest response is considered and overwrites the previous one. If the session timings are changed, all invite responses are cleared, and learners need to respond to the request once again.

## Enabling the invite-reply-tracking feature {#enablingtheinvitereplytrackingfeature}

* Contact Adobe Prime Support to enable the invite-reply-tracking feature. 
* Once the feature is enabled for the account, all future Virtual Class/Class Room sessions created by an author can record the learner's response to the calendar invite.

If learners are enrolled to a Virtual Class/Class Room session created before the invite-reply-tracking feature being enabled, then learner's responses to the calendar invite are not recorded.

## Viewing invite responses as an admin {#viewinginviteresponsesasanadmin}

If a Virtual Class/Class Room session has the invite-reply-tracking feature enabled, then the admin can view the learner's responses to the invite along with other permissions as follows:

1. Click **Course** from the left navigation panel and view the course that was created after the enablement of the invite-reply-tracking feature.
