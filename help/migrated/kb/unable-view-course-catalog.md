# Unable to view certain course under catalog while creating a Learning Program

## Issue

While searching for a particular course to add it to a Learning Program, you are unable to view the course under the catalog.

## Types of enrollment

There are three enrollment type in Learning Manager:

* Self-enrolled
* Manager nominated
* Manager approved

## Self enrolled

Learners can directly enroll themselves to these types of courses.

## Manager approved

These courses must be approved by Managers. Learners can sign-up for these courses, but they are not enrolled directly to these type of courses without Manager's approval. A notification request is sent to Managers when learners sign-up for these types of courses. Upon Manager's approval, these courses will be listed as enrolled for learners.

## Manager nominated

These courses can only be nominated by managers. A Learner cannot enroll to these types of courses.

## What's next

In a Learning program, you can only add self enrolled courses and not Manager nominated or Manager approved courses.

This is a default behavior in Learning Manager.
