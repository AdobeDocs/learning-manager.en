# Issues with retiring a Learning Program {#issues-with-retiring-a-learning-program}

Captivate Prime&nbsp;Learning Programs&nbsp;are renamed to&nbsp;Learning Paths.&nbsp;This change happens immediately&nbsp;after the October 2021 release and&nbsp;the terminology of&nbsp;Learning Path&nbsp;is&nbsp;reflected for all roles.

## **Issue**

A Learning Program automatically gets retired.

## **Cause**

There are situations where a Learning Program has retired without an Administrator/Author retiring the LP explicitly.

This issue occurs because a Learning Program is a collection of courses. The higher order trainings retire, if any of the courses within it contains a retired instance or the course instance retires.

## **Resolution**

To check the course that contains a retired instance, follow the steps below:

1. Log in as an administrator and launch the relevant Learning Program.  

1. Click **Instances **> **Courses**. The page lists all the courses that are a part of this Learning Program. You will be able to see the course that contains a retired instance.&nbsp;

1. Once you have figured out the course instance that has retired, click&nbsp;**Courses **> **Open the course**.&nbsp;  

1. Click **Instances. **On the retired instance, click **Edit **and then edit the completion date to a future date to which you want the instance to retire.&nbsp;
