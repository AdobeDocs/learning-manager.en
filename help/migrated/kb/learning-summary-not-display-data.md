# Learning Summary does not display current data {#learning-summary-does-not-display-current-data}

## Issue

In Adobe Captivate Prime,&nbsp;Learning Summary does not display current data for Enrollment, Completion, or Progressions.

There are situations when a learner completes a course. However, the data is not visible in the Learning Summary when viewed by an Administrator or Manager.&nbsp;

## Cause

The issue occurs because the Learning Summary is updated at different times,&nbsp;based on the criteria that you have selected.

## Refresh duration

The Learning Summary data refreshes according to the following schedules:

1. **This Month:** The data refreshes everyday. You can view the last refreshed time at the bottom of the page.
1. **Last 3 Full Months:** This data refreshes once a month.&nbsp;
1. **Last 12 Full Months:**&nbsp;This data refreshes once a month.&nbsp;
