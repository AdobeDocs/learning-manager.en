# Unable to assign a badge {#unable-to-assign-a-badge}

`Learning Manager Learning Programs are renamed to Learning Paths. This change happens immediately after the October 2021 release and the terminology of Learning Path is reflected for all roles.`

# **Issue**

Even after completing a course or training, a badge does not get awarded as expected.

# **Description**

After a learner completes a Course/Learning Program/Certification, the badge does not get awarded to the learner.

# **Cause**

The badge that is assigned to the Learning Object is added after the learner has completed the&nbsp;Learning Object.

In the earlier version, a badge could not be added later, if there was no badge assigned to a Learning Object at the time the learner completed the Learning Object.

In current versions, the feature is available.

# **Resolution**

If a learner experiences the issue, try the steps below:

## **Course/Learning Program**

1. Log in as administrator.  

1. Open the relevant Learning Object (Course/Learning Program).  

1. Click&nbsp;**Instances **> **Badge**.

1. Click&nbsp;**Overview **> **Badge**.
1. Remove the badge from the Certification and click **Save**.
