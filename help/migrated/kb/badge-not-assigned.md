# Unable to assign a badge

## Issue

Even after completing a course or training, a badge does not get awarded as expected.

## Description

After a learner completes a Course/Learning Program/Certification, the badge does not get awarded to the learner.

## Cause

The badge that is assigned to the Learning Object is added after the learner has completed the Learning Object.

In the earlier version, a badge could not be added later, if there was no badge assigned to a Learning Object at the time the learner completed the Learning Object.

In current versions, the feature is available.

## Resolution

If a learner experiences the issue, try the steps below:

## Course/Learning Program

1. Log in as administrator.  

1. Open the relevant Learning Object (Course/Learning Program).  

1. Click **[!UICONTROL Instances]** > **[!UICONTROL Badge]**.

1. Remove the badge from the Learning Object and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

   This step will assign the badge to all learners enrolled for the Learning Object.

## Certification

1. Log in as Admin.  
1. Open the Certification.  
1. Click **[!UICONTROL Overview]** > **[!UICONTROL Badge]**.
1. Remove the badge from the Certification and click **[!UICONTROL Save]**.
