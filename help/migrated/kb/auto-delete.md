# User gets auto deleted in Captivate Prime

## Issue

A user gets deleted from Captivate Prime, however, the Administrator never performed any such action.

## `Cause`

In Adobe Captivate Prime, there is an option that allows you to delete a user if he/she has not logged into the system for a certain amount of time.

## How to change/apply the setting?

#### For Internal Learners:

1. Log in as an **Administrator**.
1. Under **Configure**, click **Settings **> **General**.
1. In the General settings page, see for the option **Auto-delete Internal Users**.
1. Click **Edit **to enter the number of days in the field, to auto delete a Learner if they have not accessed the system.

   Leave the field blank in case you do not want to delete users automatically.

1. Click **Save **to retain the settings made.

#### For External Learners:

1. Log in as an **Administrator**.
1. Under **Manage**, click **Users **> **External**.
1. Click the name of an External User for which the setting needs to be applied.

   This opens the **Edit External Registration Profile** window.

1. Click **Advanced Settings **at the bottom left corner.
