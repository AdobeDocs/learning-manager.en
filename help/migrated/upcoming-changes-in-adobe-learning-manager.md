# What's new in Adobe Learning Manager October release

## Overview of the release

The October 2025 release of Adobe Learning Manager introduces significant enhancements designed to improve reporting accuracy, expand integration capabilities, and enhance the learning experience for administrators, authors, and learners. Key improvements include enhanced Learner Transcripts that accurately capture instructor-marked completions, extended User Reports with additional identification fields, and Job Aids reports with direct download links. 

This release also introduces scoped announcement permissions for custom administrators, user tagging functionality in social learning boards, and language-based progress tracking that preserves learner progress across different locales. Additional features include Go1 integration enhancements with AI-assisted playlist creation, enhanced custom role management with incremental import support, and improved APIs for better quiz performance tracking and migration status monitoring.

## Instructor-marked completions in Learner Transcripts

**Overview**

Incremental Learner Transcripts now capture instructor-marked completions, even if attendance is recorded after the session date.
This enhancement addresses a critical gap in incremental Learner Transcripts where instructor-marked completions were previously missed if attendance was recorded after the original session date.

Incremental Learner Transcripts are scheduled reports that capture only the changes (such as completions or progress updates) that occur within a specified period, rather than providing a full historical data dump. They are commonly used for automation, dashboards, and integrations, allowing users to efficiently track recent learning activities without processing the entire transcript history each time.

**What's new**

* **Mark Completed Date (UTC TimeZone) column**: A new timestamp column that captures the exact date and time when an instructor marks a session or module as complete.
* **Enhanced completion source tracking**: Tracks the specific instructor and module (for example, "Classroom") where completions were recorded.

These changes ensure that completions marked after the session date are accurately reflected in incremental Learner Transcripts.

**Key benefits**

* Captures all completions in incremental reports, regardless of when attendance is marked.
* Provides a clear audit trail for compliance and reporting.
* Supports automation and dashboards for regulatory requirements.

**Use cases**

* Organizations with classroom sessions where instructors may mark attendance days after the actual session. 
* Automated systems or dashboards relying on incremental Learner Transcripts for compliance or reporting.

### Learner Transcript with the new column

## Enhanced User Report with extended data fields

**Overview**

The User Report now includes additional fields to improve user tracking and organizational mapping.

**What's new**

* Internal User ID column: Provides unique internal identifiers for smooth user tracking across different systems and API endpoints.
* Manager Email column: Includes direct manager contact information for organizational hierarchy tracking.

**Key benefits**

* Simplified user identification and eliminates issues when mapping users across multiple systems.
* Supports downstream user management workflows through integration capabilities.
* Improved organizational mapping and better understanding of reporting relationships.
* Maintains organizational boundaries and prevents accidental cross-communication.

**Important considerations**

* If a custom administrator's scope changes, affected announcements display a warning icon and require individual scope resets.
* Each announcement must be updated individually when scope changes occur.
* The Notification Announcement report shows only learners within the custom administrator's assigned scope.

### User Report with the new column

See this [article](/help/migrated/administrators/feature-summary/reports.md#user-activity-dashboards) to learn how to download the User Report.

## FTP User Report with Internal User ID support

**Overview**

The FTP-based User Report now includes Internal User ID support, providing a unified approach to data export and integration for headless implementations.

**What's new**

* User Reports are now available through [Custom FTP](/help/migrated/integration-admin/feature-summary/connectors.md#custom-ftp) alongside existing reports (Gamification Transcripts, Learner Transcripts, Trainings Report).
* The Internal User ID column is now consistent across all export methods (FTP, Jobs API, and UI).

**Key benefits**

* Simplified data management with a single source for all necessary reports.
* Better data consistency by ensuring uniform user identification across reporting periods.
* Automated workflow support by enabling bulk operations and analytics workflows with consistent identifiers.
The User Report downloaded from FTP folder contains the new column, Internal User ID.

## Include suspended users in Learner Transcripts

**Overview**

Organizations can now include suspended users (those with disabled external profiles) in Learner Transcripts, ensuring comprehensive historical learning data retention.

**What's new**

* Configurable suspended user visibility with an account-level flag to include suspended users in the Learner Transcripts.
* Historical data retention even after deactivation of suspended external profiles.

**Implementation requirements**

* Contact your Customer Success Manager (CSM) to enable the account-level flag.

>[!NOTE]
>
>This flag is disabled by default for existing accounts and must be explicitly requested for new accounts.

## Scoped announcement permissions for custom administrators

**Overview**

Custom administrators can now create announcements, but only for their assigned user groups or catalogs. This prevents unintended communication across organizational boundaries.

**What's new**

* Custom administrators can only create announcements for users within their assigned scope.
* Announcements can be scoped to specific user groups or catalogs.
* Full administrators maintain visibility and control over all announcements, including those created by scoped custom administrators.

**Key benefits**

* Targeted communication ensuring announcements reach only relevant audiences.
* Reduced information overload by preventing irrelevant notifications from reaching unintended users.
* Maintains organizational boundaries and prevents accidental cross-communication.

**Important considerations**

* If a custom administrator's scope changes, affected announcements display a warning icon and require individual scope resets.
* Each announcement must be updated individually when scope changes occur.
* The Notification Announcement report shows only learners within the custom administrator's assigned scope.

**Use cases**

* Franchise organizations where regional managers need to communicate only with their franchisees.
* Large organizations with regional or departmental administrators targeting announcements to their teams.

### Create announcement for the assigned scope

A custom administrator can create announcements limited to their assigned user groups and catalogs, ensuring messages reach the right audience and preventing unnecessary notifications.

To create an announcement for the assigned scope:

1. Log in to Adobe Learning Manager as an administrator.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Announcement]** in the left navigation pane.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Add]**.

   _Announcements page in Adobe Learning Manager, where administrators can create and manage announcements for targeted user groups_

4. Select the **[!UICONTROL Announcement Type]** from the dropdown menu.
        a. **[!UICONTROL As Notification]**
        b. **[!UICONTROL As Masthead]**
        c. **[!UICONTROL As Recommendation]**
        d. **[!UICONTROL As Email]**
5. Select **[!UICONTROL As Masthead]**. 
6. Select the language and upload an image for the masthead. 
7. Optionally, add a URL for the action button. 
   
   ![](/help/migrated/assets/announcement-screen.png)
   _Create Announcement screen allowing administrators to set announcement type, upload attachments, and add action buttons_

    The assigned scope is pre-selected in the **[!UICONTROL Scope]** section and cannot be modified by administrators.
    
    >[!NOTE]
    >
    >**[!UICONTROL For Notification]** and **[!UICONTROL Email]** announcements, they can include additional user groups and catalogs if these overlap with their assigned scope.

8. Select **[!UICONTROL Save]**.

Only learners within the custom administrator's scope will be able to view the announcement. See this [article](/help/migrated/administrators/feature-summary/announcements.md) to learn how to create multiple types of announcements. 

## Tag users in social boards

**Overview**

Social learning boards now support user tagging functionality, enabling more targeted discussions and improved collaboration within learning communities. Learners can be tagged in social learning posts and comments through the learner app, APIs, and Adobe Learning Manager reference site.

**What's new**

* **@username tagging**: Users can tag other board members using the "@username" format.
* **Scope-restricted tagging**: Only users with access to the specific board can be tagged, ensuring privacy and relevance.
* **Multi-channel notifications**: Tagged users receive both in-app and email notifications with direct links to relevant posts or comments.

**Key features**

* Users outside the board's scope cannot be tagged, preventing unwanted notifications.
* If a tagged user is deleted from the system, their mention appears as "anonymous".
* Tagging user groups or "@all" is not permitted to prevent notification spam.

**Use cases**

* Healthcare professionals seeking input from specific colleagues on medical cases.
* Subject matter experts being consulted on specialized topics.
* Team discussions requiring input from specific stakeholders.
* Knowledge sharing sessions with targeted expert involvement.

### Tag users in social board posts

Learners can now tag specific board members in posts or comments using @username. Tagging is limited to members with access to that board.

To tag users in a social board:

1. Log in to Adobe Learning Manager as a learner. 
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Social Learning]** in the left navigation pane.
   
   ![](/help/migrated/assets/select-social-learning-admin.png)
   _Enable collaborative learning by selecting Social Learning to access discussion boards, share insights, and tag users for interactive engagement_

3. Select **[!UICONTROL New Post]**.
   
   ![](assets/select-new-post.png)
   _Start a new discussion by selecting New Post in Social Learning to share knowledge with the tagged users_

4. Before tagging users, select the board from the **[!UICONTROL Post this to a Discussion Board]** option.

   ![](assets/select-boards-in-social-board.png)
   _Select a discussion board to post and tag users, enabling targeted collaborative conversations in Social Learning_

5. Type your post details, then tag a user by entering the @ symbol followed by their name (for example, @andrew). When you type @ followed by the first three letters of the user's name, it displays a list of matching users.
 
   ![](assets/type-a-user-tag.png)
   _Tag users in your discussion post by typing @ followed by the username to enable targeted collaboration within Social Learning boards_

6. Select the desired user from the list.
7. Select **[!UICONTROL Post]**. 

The tagged users receive both in-app and email notifications with a direct link to the post, making discussions more targeted and collaborative.

### Tag users based on the board's scope

Scope-restricted tagging allows users to tag only those learners who have permission to access a specific board. This helps maintain privacy by preventing tagging of users outside the scope. 

If you try tagging learners who are outside the board's scope, no suggestions will appear, and you won't be able to tag them. Refer to this [article](/help/migrated/administrators/feature-summary/social-learning-configurations-as-an-admin.md) to learn more about Social Learning Scope. 

## Tag deleted users in comments

If a user who has been deleted is tagged in a Social Learning post, their name will show as Anonymous in the post. The comment and tag remain visible for context, but profile link or details are not shown.

## Job Aids report with direct access links

**Overview**

The Job Aids report has been enhanced to include direct download links to job aids, streamlining content management and audit processes for administrators and authors.

**What's new**

* Job Aid Link column: Direct access to job aid files and external URLs from within the report.
* Role-based access control: Link accessibility depends on user roles and catalog permissions.
* Deleted job aids remain accessible if still linked to active courses.

**Key benefits**

* Direct file downloads and URL access from within the report.
* Eliminates manual effort in locating and downloading job aids for compliance or accessibility audits. 

**Use cases**

* Authors or administrators conduct regular accessibility audits on job aids, as required by large organizations.
* Any scenario where quick, role-based access to job aid files is needed for review or compliance.

### Job Aids Report with the new column

## API updates

### Learner API enhancements for quiz performance tracking

**Overview**

The `GET /loResourceGrades` API has been enhanced to provide detailed quiz performance data, enabling more sophisticated analytics and automated decision-making.

**What's new**

The API response now includes two additional fields:

* **[!UICONTROL highestScore]**: The best score achieved by a learner across all quiz attempts
* **[!UICONTROL maxScore]**: The total possible score for the quiz

**API response example**

```
{
    "links": {
        "self": "https://learningmanagerstage1.adobe.com/primeapi/v2/loResourceGrades/course:15067_30122_41715_1_3400468"
    },
    "data": {
        "id": "course:15067_30122_41715_1_3400468",
        "type": "learningObjectResourceGrade",
        "attributes": {
            "completed": false,
            "duration": 0,
            "hasPassed": false,
            "highestScore": 0,
            "maxScore": 0,. 
            "progressPercent": 0,
            "score": 0
        },
        "relationships": {
            "loResource": {
                "data": {
                    "id": "course:15067_30122_41715_1",
                    "type": "learningObjectResource"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In response, **course:15067_30122_41715_1_3400468** is the ID of the Learning Object resource grade for which the information is being requested. The `learningObjectResourceGrad`e id can be obtained from the `GET /enrollments/{id}` API.  

**Key benefits**

* Enables detailed quiz performance analysis for learning effectiveness measurement.
* Supports progression rules based on highest achievement rather than most recent attempts.
* Provides complete picture of learner quiz performance over time.

**How the API works**

1. A user attempts a quiz multiple times; each attempt is recorded.
2. The API provides both the highest score achieved and the maximum possible score for the quiz.
3. External systems can use this data to trigger automated actions, such as enrolling users in new courses based on their best performance.

**Use cases**

* Headless learning systems require automated enrollment decisions.
* Learning analytics platforms tracking learner achievement patterns.
* Compliance systems with performance-based progression requirements.

### Migration API enhancements

**Overview**
Adobe Learning Manager now supports the migration of various data objects into an account via the migration process. This process can be initiated via both APIs and the User Interface. When a migration fails, errors are available for download via the interface. These errors are useful in debugging migration errors and managing the migration runs. 

With this release, the error logs will also be available to download via the APIs for efficient, programmatic error tracking and debugging.

**API changes**

There is a new migration API, `runStatus`, which allows integration administrators to check the status of migration runs triggered via the API, something not possible in previous versions of Adobe Learning Manager. 

Additionally, `runStatus` API now provides a direct link to download error logs (CSV) for completed runs. Note that the link is valid for seven days only, and the logs are retained for one month.

The `startRun` API's response has been updated to include the migration project ID, sprint ID, and sprint run ID, which are required to query the new status endpoint. 

#### runStatus API

**Description**

Retrieves the status of an existing migration run.

**Endpoint**

```
GET /bulkimport/runStatus
```

**Parameters**

* **migrationProjectId**: (Required). A unique identifier for a migration project. A migration project is used to transfer data and content from an existing Learning Management System (LMS) to Adobe Learning Manager. Each migration project can consist of multiple sprints, which are smaller units of migration tasks.

* **sprintId**: (Required). A unique identifier for a sprint within a migration project. A sprint is a subset of migration tasks that includes specific learning items (e.g., courses, modules, learner records) to be migrated from an existing LMS to Adobe Learning Manager. Each sprint can be executed independently, allowing for phased migration.

* **sprintRunId**: (Required). A unique identifier used to track the execution of a specific sprint within a migration project. It's associated with the actual migration process for the items defined in a sprint. The sprintRunId helps in monitoring, troubleshooting, and managing the migration job.

**Response**

```
{
  "sprintId": 2510080,
  "sprintRunId": 2740845,
  "migrationProjectId": 2509173,
  "startTime": 1746524711052,
  "endTime": 1746524711052,
  [

      "lastHeartbeatTime": 1746524711052,
      "objectName": "content",
      "jobState": "COMPLETED",
      "errorCsvLink": "",
      "errorLogLink": "migration/5830/2509173/2510080/2740845/content_err.csv",
      "sequenceNumber": 1
    },
    {
      "id": 2609922,
      "lastHeartbeatTime": 1746524713577,
      "objectName": "course",
      "jobState": "WAITING_IN_QUEUE",
      "errorCsvLink": "",
      "errorLogLink": null,
      "sequenceNumber": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

#### startRun API

The `startRun` API response was updated to include three additional fields- migrationProjectId, sprintId, and sprintRunId. These fields allow users to track and query the status of specific migration runs using the new runStatus API.

```
curl -X GET --header 'Accept: text/html' 'https://learningmanager.adobe.com/primeapi/v2/bulkimport/runStatus?migrationProjectId=001&sprintId=10001&sprintRunId=7'
```

Produces the following response. The response contains:

* migrationId
* sprintId
* sprintRunId

**Response**

```
{
  "status": "OK",
  "title": "BULKIMPORT_RUN_INITIATED_SUCCESSFULLY",
  "source": {
    "info": "Success",
    "migrationInfo": {
      "migrationProjectId": "001",
      "sprintId": "10001",
      "sprintRunId": "7"
    }
  }
}
```

### Social API changes (user tag, comments, and replies)

**Overview**

Adobe Learning Manager now supports @user tagging functionality in Social Learning boards, enabling learners to mention and notify peers within posts, comments, and replies. This feature enhances collaboration and content discovery across the platform.

This release introduces new API capabilities to support user mentions, including enhanced POST and GET endpoints, as well as a new search functionality for tagged users.

    }
  ]
}
```

### Social API changes (user search)

**Endpoint**

```
GET /primeapi/v2/users/search?q={searchTerm}&context=tagging
```

**Description**

Search for users available for tagging based on social scope settings.

**Request parameters**


* q (required): Search term (minimum 3 characters).
* context: Set to "tagging" to get users eligible for mentions.
* boardId (optional): Board ID to filter users based on access permissions.

**Response**

```
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "11257229",
      "type": "user",
      "attributes": {
        "name": "Jane Smith",
        "email": "jane.smith@example.com",
        "avatarUrl": "https://cpcontents.adobe.com/public/images/default_user_avatar.svg",
        "userType": "Internal",
        "state": "ACTIVE"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Implementation guidelines

#### Character limits

* Posts: 4000-character limit applies, with each tagged user reducing available characters by a fixed amount.
* Comments: 1000-character limit.

#### Mention validation

* Users can only be tagged by username or email (not UUID).
* Internal users cannot tag external users and vice versa.
* Tagging availability follows existing social scope settings.
* Board permissions determine tagging eligibility (Public/Private).

#### Notifications

* Multiple mentions of the same user in one post result in a single notification.
* Original post owner receives notifications only when specifically tagged.

#### Error handling

* Invalid user IDs in mentions return validation errors.
* GDPR and soft-deleted users appear anonymous in tagged content.

### Language-based learner progress

Currently, learner progress is tracked only for the selected locale language, causing significant progress loss when switching languages/locales in the player. This limitation creates poor user experience where learners lose their learning progress when exploring content in different languages.

**Current issues**

* **Progress override**: The progress for each module in the player is tracked at both the user and module levels. This leads to a situation where a user's progress is overridden when they switch back to a previously used locale for the same module.
* **Progress reset**: For instance, if a learner achieves 75% progress in Locale A (English) and then switches to Locale B (Spanish), upon returning to Locale A, their progress resets to 0% instead of resuming from 75%.

To resolve these limitations, the API has been enhanced to support locale-specific progress tracking:

* **Locale-specific storage**: When a learner switches locales (for example, from Locale A to Locale B) within the player, the system now saves the progress state separately for each locale of the content.
* **Progress resumption**: When the user switches back to a previously used locale (from Locale B back to Locale A), the content resumes from where they left off in that specific locale.
* **Independent progress tracking**: Each locale maintains its own state of progress, allowing learners to explore content in multiple languages without losing their individual progress in each language.

#### API changes

The following APIs have been enhanced to support the new locale parameter:

* GET Player State API
* POST Player State API

#### GET Player State API

**Endpoint**

```
GET /primeapi/v2/users/{userId}/playerState
```

**Description**

Retrieves the current state of a learning object for a specific user and locale.

**Parameters**

## Save player state progress for languages

**Overview**

The Fluidic Player now saves your progress separately for each language within a module. This means you can switch between languages and pick up exactly where you left off in each one, instead of losing your progress and starting over.

**Key benefits**

* Jump between languages and resume from your exact position in each one.
* Perfect for learners who need to access content in multiple languages during their learning journey.
* Complete the module in any language while maintaining progress in all languages you've accessed.

**Use cases**

* Global organizations with employees who speak multiple languages and may need to reference content in their native language and English.
* Compliance training where learners might start in one language but need to complete in another for certification purposes.
* Technical training programs where learners might understand concepts better in their native language but need English terminology for their work.

**Important notes**

* The Fluidic Player's language preference is retained within a session. If a learner changes the language and moves to another module, the new language is used for subsequent modules, as long as the player remains open.
* The grade (completion status) is still tracked at the module level, not per locale. The first locale in which the completion criteria are met will update the grade for the module. If a learner completes the module in one language and then switches to another, any further grade updates will be overwritten from the previous grade, but progress for each locale is still preserved.

## Custom roles import support in incremental user import

Adobe Learning Manager now supports custom role imports in the existing multi-incremental user import workflow (regular full user import + incremental enabled flow). This enhancement allows role.csv and user_role.csv files to be uploaded and processed incrementally, without requiring full data uploads each time.

Previously, role.csv and user_role.csv files could only be uploaded in full mode, meaning administrators had to include all previously added role definitions and assignments in every upload. With this new incremental support, only new or modified role data needs to be uploaded, reducing overheads and improving efficiency.

**What's new**

1. Incremental support for custom roles and role assignments:

    * role.csv  and  user_role.csv can now be processed incrementally in the multi-file incremental workflow.
    * No need to upload all existing role and user role data with every import.

2. Enhanced multi-incremental workflow implementation:

    * Create separate folders in FTP for each uploaded user import file.
    * Each folder contains:

        * The user import file- (File1.csv)
        * Corresponding role and role assignment files- (File1_role.csv, File1_user_role.csv)

    For example, user1.csv corresponds to user1_role.csv (custom roles) and user1_user_roles.csv (user-role mapping).

    **Example FTP structure before processing:**

    ```
    import/user/internal/  
         File1.csv  
         File2.csv  
        File3.csv  

    UserRole/  
        File1_role.csv  
        File1_user_role.csv  
        File2_role.csv  
        File2_user_role.csv  
        File3_role.csv  
        File3_user_role.csv  
    ```
 
3. Adobe Learning Manager also supports up to 20 incremental user CSVs and their corresponding custom roles CSVs, making it suitable for large-scale operations.

**Use cases**

* Global companies manage regional teams by uploading multiple incremental user files for each region (EU, America, Asia), allowing administrators to update users and assign new roles for each region in a single workflow.
* Large enterprises automate onboarding and permissions by regularly ingesting incremental user updates from HR systems. This supports seamless updates to user profiles and granular role assignments without manual intervention.

## Reset recommendations in Salesforce app

**Overview**

Previously, learners using the Adobe Learning Manager Salesforce app could only select roles and recommendation preferences once. If their role changed, they were required to access the native Adobe Learning Manager app to update their profile and receive relevant course recommendations. This made the learning experience and contributed to lower engagement within the Salesforce environment.

**What's new**

Adobe Learning Manager now features a  **[!UICONTROL Reset Interests]** button within the Salesforce app. Learners can now reset their roles and learning preferences without needing to leave Salesforce or sign in into the native Adobe Learning Manager app. This enhancement streamlines access to personalized learning content, ensuring recommendations remain relevant as users' roles evolve.

**Use cases**

* Learners who change job roles, teams, or responsibilities can quickly reset their preferences to receive updated and relevant course recommendations all within the Salesforce app.
* By removing the need to switch to the native Adobe Learning Manager app, the learning journey is smoother, encouraging ongoing engagement and consumption of recommended content through Salesforce.
* Administrators benefit from higher rates of learning completion and better alignment between user roles and recommended content, without extra support or guidance on switching platforms.

### Reset interest in the Salesforce app

To reset the interests and recommendations from the Salesforce app:

1. Log in to Adobe Learning Manager app for Salesforce as a learner.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Reset Interests]** option at the bottom.

The learner's recommendation or interest will be reset from the Adobe Learning Manager Salesforce app.

**Introduction**

Experience Builder is a no-code/low-code tool in Adobe Learning Manager that helps you create customized learning portals. It allows you to design branded, user-friendly learning portals without needing technical skills or extensive coding knowledge.
With Experience Builder, you can create new pages, menus, and widgets to deliver personalized learning experiences for your audience quickly and easily. With Experience Builder, you can quickly create new pages, menus, and widgets to deliver personalized learning experiences for your audience.

**Problem statement**

Before Experience Builder, organizations faced several challenges:

1. **Limited customization**: Portals had fixed designs with few options to reflect your brand. Administrators could only make basic changes, such as modifying headers, footers, or colors, which limited the ability to create unique experiences.
2. **Cost**: Building custom portals required expensive developers and long timelines, often taking 6 to 9 months to complete. This approach increased the total cost of ownership and delayed deployment.
3. **Generic experiences**: Everyone saw the same content, even if it wasn't relevant to their role or needs. This lack of personalization reduced learner engagement and satisfaction.
4. **Technical barriers**: Non-technical administrators struggled to create or update portals because they needed coding knowledge or external support.

Experience Builder solves these problems by providing a simple, no-code/low-code solution for creating personalized, branded portals.

It allows administrators to design portals that meet their organization's needs without relying on technical expertise or external developers.

**Key benefits**

* Manage page lifecycle with draft and published states.
* Hide pages from menus while keeping them accessible via direct links.

For example, a page for sales training might include widgets displaying relevant courses, testimonials, and a calendar of upcoming sessions.

#### Menus

Menus organize pages into navigable structures for learners. Administrators can:

* Create custom menus to group pages for specific user groups.
* Add hierarchy and ordering to prioritize visibility for specific audiences.
* Include submenus for grouping related pages.

For example, a menu called Resources might include pages for eBooks, videos, and FAQs.

#### Widgets

Widgets allow administrators to add dynamic content and functionality to pages. The following widgets are available:

* Calendar
* Categories
* Compliance Status
* Courses & Paths
* Content Box
* Gamification
* HTML
* Iframe

#### Set up hidden pages

The hide pages option allows administrators to keep the Learner UI clean by showing fewer pages. Administrators can hide pages from the menu so learners don't see them in learner UI, but learners can still reach those pages in other ways. For example, the Catalog page can be hidden from the menu but accessed through other navigation paths.

<!-- We're excited to share several important updates coming to Adobe Learning Manager with the upcoming releases. These enhancements aim to streamline admin workflows, improve data reporting accuracy, and strengthen role-based controls.

These changes are designed to reduce manual effort, support automation, and improve governance across training operations.

## Capture instructor-marked completions in Learner Transcript

### Audience  

Administrator and automation owners 

### Overview 

In Adobe Learning Manager, when using incremental Learner Transcripts (LT) for automation workflows, instructor-marked completions made after the session date are not captured. The completion timestamp reflects the original session end time (not the time the instructor marked the completion). Since these updates fall outside the one-day change window used for incremental LT generation, as a result, learners' attendance and completion data are excluded from reports, leading to inaccurate or incomplete downstream reporting and potential compliance gaps. 

### What has changed 

Learner Transcript (LT) reports include completions marked by instructors after the session date. This ensures that any delayed attendance marking is correctly reflected in the transcript export. 

Attendance states like "Attended with pass/fail" will appear automatically in incremental LT exports. 

### What's new 

* New column: Mark Completed Date (UTC TimeZone). 
* Completion Source is available at module level. 
* Compatible with connector-based or job API-generated LT reports. 

![](assets/capture-instructor.png)

**Action required**

* If your automation depends on column positions, ensure logic accounts for the new column. 
* If using column names, no changes are required. 
* Retrofitted completions (manual imports) are not included. 

## Download links in Job Aids report

### Audience 

Administrator, custom administrator, and automation owners 

### Overview 

The Job Aids report includes a direct download link for each job aid, allowing quick access from the report itself. 

### What's new  

A new column, **[!UICONTROL Job Aid Link]**, has been added to the third position in the report. It links directly to the job aid if it's a file or shows the external URL provided by the author. 

Users with access (admin/authors and custom roles) can download the job aid using this link. 

![](assets/download-links-for-job-aid.png) 

### Action required 

* Review automated workflows using Job Aids reports (using Jobs API). 
* If the script is based on column position, update scripts accordingly. 
* No action is needed if using column names. 

## Internal User ID and Manager Email columns added to User Report

### Audience 

Administrators (and custom administrators) using the **[!UICONTROL User Report]** (**[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Internal]** > **[!UICONTROL Export User data]**) downloaded from the administrator User Interface. 

### Overview 

To assist in user identification and integration workflows, two columns, **[!UICONTROL Internal User ID]** and **[!UICONTROL Manager Email]** have been added to the User report, exported via the User Interface. 

### What's new 

The User report includes a user's internal user ID and their manager's email address, to map them uniquely across different tools or API endpoints. 

### Action required 

* If using this report in automated flows, then this newly added column should be taken care of in automation.  
* No changes are needed if workflows are not impacted. 

## Scoped announcement permissions for custom administrators

### Audience 

Custom administrators 

### Overview 

Custom administrators can create announcements only for the user groups or catalogs within their defined scope. 

### What's new 

* Scoping rules allow custom administrators to create announcements for specific user groups or catalogs only. 
* When defining a custom role, administrators can assign announcement permissions with scope on user groups or catalogs. 
* Custom administrators are limited to creating announcements within their given scope. 
* The notification announcement report for custom administrators will display learners only within their assigned scope. 

### Action required 

* The format of the report will remain unchanged. If custom administrators download it from the User Interface, the content of the report will be subject to their scope. 
* No modifications are necessary if this report is not utilized in any automated or downstream workflow.
