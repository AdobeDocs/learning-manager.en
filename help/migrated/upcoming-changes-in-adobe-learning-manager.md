# Upcoming changes in Adobe Learning Manager

We're excited to share several important updates coming to Adobe Learning Manager with the upcoming releases. These enhancements aim to streamline admin workflows, improve data reporting accuracy, and strengthen role-based controls.

These changes are designed to reduce manual effort, support automation, and improve governance across training operations.

## Capture instructor-marked completions in Learner Transcript (M44) 

### Audience  

Administrator and automation owners 

### Overview 

In Adobe Learning Manager, when using incremental Learner Transcripts (LT) for automation workflows, instructor-marked completions made after the session date are not captured. The completion timestamp reflects the original session end time (not the time the instructor marked the completion). Since these updates fall outside the one-day change window used for incremental LT generation, as a result, learners' attendance and completion data are excluded from reports, leading to inaccurate or incomplete downstream reporting and potential compliance gaps. 

### What has changed 

Learner Transcript (LT) reports include completions marked by instructors after the session date. This ensures that any delayed attendance marking is correctly reflected in the transcript export. 

Attendance states like "Attended with pass/fail" will appear automatically in incremental LT exports. 

### What's new 

* New column: Mark Completed Date (UTC TimeZone). 
* Completion Source is available at module level. 
* Compatible with connector-based or job API-generated LT reports.

**Action required**

* If your automation depends on column positions, ensure logic accounts for the new column. 
* If using column names, no changes are required. 
* Retrofitted completions (manual imports) are not included. 

## Download links in Job Aids report (M44) 

### Audience 

Administrator, custom administrator, and automation owners 

### Overview 

The Job Aids report includes a direct download link for each job aid, allowing quick access from the report itself. 

### What's new  

A new column, **[!UICONTROL Job Aid Link]**, has been added to the third position in the report. It links directly to the job aid if it's a file or shows the external URL provided by the author. 

Users with access (admin/authors and custom roles) can download the job aid using this link.

### Action required 

* Review automated workflows using Job Aids reports (using Jobs API). 
* If the script is based on column position, update scripts accordingly. 
* No action is needed if using column names. 

## Internal User ID and Manager Email columns added to User Report (M44) 

### Audience 

Administrators (and custom administrators) using the **[!UICONTROL User Report]** (**[!UICONTROL Admin]** > **[!UICONTROL Users]** > **[!UICONTROL Internal]** > **[!UICONTROL Export User data]**) downloaded from the administrator User Interface. 

### Overview 

To assist in user identification and integration workflows, two columns, **[!UICONTROL Internal User ID]** and **[!UICONTROL Manager Email]** have been added to the User report, exported via the User Interface. 

### What's new 

The User report includes a user's internal user ID and their manager's email address, to map them uniquely across different tools or API endpoints. 

### Action required 

* If using this report in automated flows, then this newly added column should be taken care of in automation.  
* No changes are needed if workflows are not impacted. 

## Scoped announcement permissions for custom administrators (M44) 

### Audience 

Custom administrators 

### Overview 

Custom administrators can create announcements only for the user groups or catalogs within their defined scope. 

### What's new 

* Scoping rules allow custom administrators to create announcements for specific user groups or catalogs only. 
* When defining a custom role, administrators can assign announcement permissions with scope on user groups or catalogs. 
* Custom administrators are limited to creating announcements within their given scope. 
* The notification announcement report for custom administrators will display learners only within their assigned scope. 

### Action required 

* The format of the report will remain unchanged. If custom administrators download it from the User Interface, the content of the report will be subject to their scope. 
* No modifications are necessary if this report is not utilized in any automated or downstream workflow.
