**Introduction**

Experience Builder is a no-code/low-code tool in Adobe Learning Manager that helps you create customized learning portals. It allows you to design branded, user-friendly learning portals without needing technical skills or extensive coding knowledge.
With Experience Builder, you can create new pages, menus, and widgets to deliver personalized learning experiences for your audience quickly and easily. With Experience Builder, you can quickly create new pages, menus, and widgets to deliver personalized learning experiences for your audience.


## Language-based learner progress

Currently, learner progress is tracked only for the selected locale language, causing significant progress loss when switching languages/locales in the player. This limitation creates poor user experience where learners lose their learning progress when exploring content in different languages.

**Current issues**

* **Progress override**: The progress for each module in the player is tracked at both the user and module levels. This leads to a situation where a user's progress is overridden when they switch back to a previously used locale for the same module.
* **Progress reset**: For instance, if a learner achieves 75% progress in Locale A (English) and then switches to Locale B (Spanish), upon returning to Locale A, their progress resets to 0% instead of resuming from 75%.

To resolve these limitations, the API has been enhanced to support locale-specific progress tracking:

* **Locale-specific storage**: When a learner switches locales (for example, from Locale A to Locale B) within the player, the system now saves the progress state separately for each locale of the content.
* **Progress resumption**: When the user switches back to a previously used locale (from Locale B back to Locale A), the content resumes from where they left off in that specific locale.
* **Independent progress tracking**: Each locale maintains its own state of progress, allowing learners to explore content in multiple languages without losing their individual progress in each language.

## Custom roles import support in incremental user import

Adobe Learning Manager now supports custom role imports in the existing multi-incremental user import workflow (regular full user import + incremental enabled flow). This enhancement allows role.csv and user_role.csv files to be uploaded and processed incrementally, without requiring full data uploads each time.

Previously, role.csv and user_role.csv files could only be uploaded in full mode, meaning administrators had to include all previously added role definitions and assignments in every upload. With this new incremental support, only new or modified role data needs to be uploaded, reducing overheads and improving efficiency.

**What's new**

1. Incremental support for custom roles and role assignments:

    * role.csv  and  user_role.csv can now be processed incrementally in the multi-file incremental workflow.
    * No need to upload all existing role and user role data with every import.

2. Enhanced multi-incremental workflow implementation:

    * Create separate folders in FTP for each uploaded user import file.
    * Each folder contains:

        * The user import file- (File1.csv)
        * Corresponding role and role assignment files- (File1_role.csv, File1_user_role.csv)

    For example, user1.csv corresponds to user1_role.csv (custom roles) and user1_user_roles.csv (user-role mapping).

    **Example FTP structure before processing:**

    ```
    import/user/internal/  
         File1.csv  
         File2.csv  
        File3.csv  

    UserRole/  
        File1_role.csv  
        File1_user_role.csv  
        File2_role.csv  
        File2_user_role.csv  
        File3_role.csv  
        File3_user_role.csv  
    ```
 
3. Adobe Learning Manager also supports up to 20 incremental user CSVs and their corresponding custom roles CSVs, making it suitable for large-scale operations.

**Use cases**

* Global companies manage regional teams by uploading multiple incremental user files for each region (EU, America, Asia), allowing administrators to update users and assign new roles for each region in a single workflow.
* Large enterprises automate onboarding and permissions by regularly ingesting incremental user updates from HR systems. This supports seamless updates to user profiles and granular role assignments without manual intervention.

### New columns added to CSV files

Three new columns have been introduced to enhance the data captured in user, role, and user-role CSV exports/imports:

* **User Registration State (user.csv)**: Indicates the current registration status of the user.
* **Role State (role.csv)**: Indicates the current status of roles within the system.
* **User Role State (user_role.csv)**: Indicates the status of the user-role association.

>The above CSV changes apply only to the accounts that use incremental users.
