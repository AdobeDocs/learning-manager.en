# API changes and enhancements

### Multi-valued active fields

For multi-valued active fields, a new property called **fields** has been added. This property can store values of type integer or string. For example,

**"fields":{** 
&nbsp; &nbsp;**"office": [ "store1", "store2", "store3" ]** 
**}**

If fields is a single valued active field, then:

**"fields":{** 
&nbsp; &nbsp;**"location": "london"** 
**}**
