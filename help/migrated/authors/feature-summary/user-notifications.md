This pop-up window displays highlights of all the notifications along with time of occurrence and a scroll bar.

You can know the number of latest notifications by the highlighted number displayed on top of the notifications icon. For example, if there are five latest notifications after your previous login, you can see the number five being displayed on top of the notifications icon. These numbers disappear once you read all the latest notifications.
