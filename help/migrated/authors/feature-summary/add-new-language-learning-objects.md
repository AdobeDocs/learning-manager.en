# Add learning objects in different locales

Read this topic to know how to add courses, certifications, and learning plans in different languages.

As authors, you have the ability to create learning objects such as courses, certifications, learning plans. You can also create these learning objects in different languages.

Learning Manager allows you to create learning objects in several languages. You can add the content and/or metadata in additional languages when you create the learning object. You can also edit your the details of your learning object any time and offer your learning object in additional languages.

To add a new language, click the Course, certification, or learning plan for which you want to add new locales. From the Basic Info page, click Add New Language at the top.

## Multi-Language Support for CR/VC Instances with Language Tagging

Adobe Learning Manager (ALM) allows authors to create language-specific instances using language tagging for Classroom and Virtual Classroom modules. This feature allows learners to access CR/VC modules in their preferred language. For example, an author can create a CR/VC module with two instances: one in English and one in French. Learners can select the instances in their preferred language.

### Workflow

First, the author creates and publishes a course in multiple languages, enabling the language options on the instance creation page. The author can then create different instances by selecting a language for each. Learners can choose the instance based on the language mapped to them.

### Create a course with multiple languages

Follow these steps to create a course with multiple languages:

1. Log in as an **[!UICONTROL Author]**.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Courses]** > **[!UICONTROL Add]** to create a course.
3. Type the **[!UICONTROL Name]** and **[!UICONTROL Description]** of the course.
4. Select **[!UICONTROL Add New Language]** and select the required languages. This will create multiple tabs for each language.

1. Log in as an **[!UICONTROL Author]**.
2. Select **[!UICONTROL Courses]** and select the multi-language course.
3. Select **[!UICONTROL Instances]** > **[!UICONTROL Add New Instance]** to create the instances.

Follow these steps to select the instance and enroll:
